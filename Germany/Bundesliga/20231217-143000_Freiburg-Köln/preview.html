<p style="font-weight: bold;">Köln travel to Freiburg on early Sunday in the Bundesliga.</p>
<p>The visitors come into the game on the back of a draw in their last match, having tied with Mainz 05 0-0 at home.</p>
<p>Freiburg, meanwhile, won their last match, 1-0 against Wolfsburg, with their goal scored by Michael Gregoritsch.</p>
<p>With Noah Atubolu between the sticks, Freiburg can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept five clean sheets in his 14 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in the Bundesliga.</p>
<p>In Köln's net, Marvin Schwäbe has two clean sheets in 14 games. He has conceded a goal every 55 minutes, only slightly more often than the 57 minutes between goals for Atubolu.</p>
