<p>In Alexander Nübel, the home team can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept five clean sheets in his 13 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in the Bundesliga.</p>
<p>In Bayer Leverkusen's net, Lukáš Hrádecký also has five clean sheets in 13 games.</p>
<p>Stuttgart are in reasonable form in the Bundesliga, with four wins and two losses from their last six games.</p>
<p>With five wins and a draw over that period, the visitors' form is better – they have taken 16 points from 18, compared to Stuttgart's 12.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Stuttgart and Bayer have played each other on 16 occasions. Stuttgart won one of them, Bayer 12, and they drew three times.</p>
