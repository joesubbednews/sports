<p style="font-weight: bold;">Relegation candidates Ayr United face a challenge against high-flying Airdrieonians at Somerset Park on Friday.</p>
<p>Ayr United are eighth in the Championship table, and have picked up 10 wins and five draws in their 29 games to date.</p>
<p>Airdrieonians, meanwhile, are fourth in the standings with 39 points, having won 11 and drawn six of their first 28 matches, and are 20 points behind table-toppers Dundee United.</p>
<p>In Joshua Rae, Airdrieonians can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept nine clean sheets in his 26 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Dundee United's Jack Walton – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in the Championship.</p>
<p>In Ayr's net, Charlie Albinson has four clean sheets in 18 games. He has conceded a goal every 59 minutes, 50% more often than the 89 minutes between goals for Rae.</p>

<p>On average, the Honest Men scored 1.5 goals and Airdrieonians 1.4 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on February 17, when Ayr won 3-2 away.</p>
<p>With 33 goals in 28 games so far this season, the away side are the league's second-lowest scorers with 1.2 goals per game. But they are conceding fewer than average too, letting in 32 goals at a rate of 1.1 per game.</p>
<p>United, meanwhile, are average scorers, with 1.4 goals per game. They have conceded 1.8 goals per game.</p>
