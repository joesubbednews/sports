<p>In their last league match, on Saturday, Inverness CT drew with Dunfermline Athletic 1-1 away, with their goal scored by Aribim Pepple.</p>
<p>Greenock Morton also drew, 0-0 at home against Raith Rovers.</p>
<p>Inverness CT are ninth in the table after 35 games, of which they have won nine and drawn 12, earning 39 points.</p>

<p>In the last 10 years, Inverness CT and Greenock Morton have played each other on 28 occasions. Inverness CT won 12 of them, Greenock Morton eight, and they drew eight times.</p>
<p>On average, ICT scored 1.6 goals and the Ton 1.1 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on March 2, when Inverness CT won 2-0 away.</p>
<p>In Ryan Mullen, the Ton can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept nine clean sheets in his 22 appearances this season, and only two other 'keepers – Dundee United's Jack Walton and Raith Rovers' Maciej Dabrowski – have been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in the Championship.</p>
<p>In the hosts' net, Mark Ridgers has seven clean sheets in 35 games. He has conceded a goal every 85 minutes, 30% more often than the 107 minutes between goals for Mullen.</p>
