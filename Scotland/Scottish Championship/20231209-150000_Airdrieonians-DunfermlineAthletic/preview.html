<p style="font-weight: bold;">Dunfermline Athletic travel to Airdrieonians on Saturday in Scottish Championship.</p>
<p>The visitors come into the game on the back of a win in their last match, having beaten Arbroath 3-0 at home, with two goals from Craig Wighton and one from Joshua Edwards.</p>
<p>Airdrieonians, meanwhile, lost their last match, 2-1 against Partick Thistle, with their goal scored by Craig Watson.</p>
<p>In Joshua Rae, Airdrieonians can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept three clean sheets in his 13 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Dundee United's Jack Walton – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in Scottish Championship.</p>
<p>In Dunfermline's net, Harrison Sharp has one clean sheet in eight games.</p>
