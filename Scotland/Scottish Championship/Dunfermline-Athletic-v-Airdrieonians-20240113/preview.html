<div class="story-inner">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Two of Scottish Championship's meanest defences go head-to-head at KDM Group East End Park on Saturday, when Airdrieonians visit Dunfermline Athletic.</p>
<p>Only one side – Dundee United – has conceded fewer goals than Airdrieonians to date: the away side have let in just 23 goals in 20 games.</p>
<p>Dunfermline have conceded 24 goals in 19 games, giving them the joint-third tightest back line so far this season.</p>
<p>Key to Airdrieonians's home form has been Joshua Rae, who has allowed one goal past him per 90 minutes, compared to 1.13 for Deniz Mehmet in the opposite net.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Dunfermline and Airdrieonians have played each other on 16 occasions. Dunfermline won five of them, Airdrieonians six, and they drew five times.</p>
<iframe src="1-match-odds.html" title="Dunfermline Athletic v Airdrieonians match odds" height="120" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
<p>On average, Dunfermline scored 1.4 goals and Airdrieonians 1.5 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on December 9, when Dunfermline won 2-1 away.</p>
<p>Dunfermline are in disappointing form in Scottish Championship, with one win and two draws from their last six games.</p>
<p>With three wins and a draw over that period, Airdrieonians's form is better – they have taken 10 points from 18, compared to Athletic's five.</p>
