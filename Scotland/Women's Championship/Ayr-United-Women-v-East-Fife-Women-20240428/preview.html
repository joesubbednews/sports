<p style="font-weight: bold;">Ayr United Women host East Fife Women in Sunday lunchtime's match at Queen Margaret Academy looking to bounce back from defeat last time out in the Women's Championship. </p>
<p> Ayr United, who sit second in the league after 18 games, fell to a 1-2 home defeat to Rossvale Women on April 14. </p>
<p> They face an East Fife side who picked up a win in their last match, a 2-1 victory against Inverness CT Women, and who sit third in the table.</p>
<p>With 65 goals in 18 games so far this season, East Fife are the league's second-highest scorers with 3.6 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 31 goals at a rate of 1.7 per game.  </p>
<p> Ayr United are also above average scorers, with 3.6 goals per game, compared to a league average of 2.8. They have conceded 1.3 goals per game.</p>

<p>The hosts are in fantastic form in the Women's Championship, with five wins and one loss from their last six games. </p>
<p> But with five wins and a draw over that period, the away team's form is even better – they have taken 16 points from 18, compared to Ayr United's 15.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, Ayr United and East Fife have played each other twice. Ayr United won both of them. </p>
<p> Their last meeting was on November 19, when Ayr United won 2-1 away.</p>
