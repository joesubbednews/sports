<p style="font-weight: bold;">Relegation candidates Stirling Albion face a challenge against high-flying Alloa Athletic at the Forthbank Stadium on Saturday.</p>
<p>Stirling Albion are eighth in the League One table, and have picked up nine wins and seven draws in their 31 games to date.</p>
<p>Alloa, meanwhile, are third in the standings with 48 points, having won 14 and drawn six, and are 33 points behind table-toppers Falkirk.</p>
<p>In Blair Currie, Stirling can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept nine clean sheets in his 31 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in League One.</p>
<p>In Alloa's net, Peter Morrison has five clean sheets in 25 games. He has conceded a goal every 59 minutes, only slightly more often than the 61 minutes between goals for Currie.</p>
