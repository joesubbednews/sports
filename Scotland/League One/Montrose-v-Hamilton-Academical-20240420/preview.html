<p style="font-weight: bold;">Hamilton Academical travel to Links Park for Saturday's match against Montrose looking to bounce back from defeat last time out in League One.</p>
<p>The Accies, who sit second in the league after 33 games, fell to a 2-0 home defeat to Falkirk on April 13.</p>
<p>They face a Montrose side who also lost their last match, a 1-0 defeat to Edinburgh City, and who sit fourth in the table.</p>
<p>With 66 goals in 33 games so far this season, Hamilton Academical are the league's second-highest scorers with 2.0 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 26 goals at a rate of 0.8 per game.</p>

<p>In Kevin O'Hara, the Accies have one of the league's sharpest shooters so far this season. He has notched 13 goals in 31 appearances, to sit fourth in the scoring charts.</p>
<p>His goal rate of one every 188 minutes is quicker than that of Kane Hester, the Gable Endies's top scorer with a goal every 234 minutes, and a total of 10 goals in 32 games.</p>
