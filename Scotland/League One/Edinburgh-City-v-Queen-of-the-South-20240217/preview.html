<p style="font-weight: bold;">Saturday's match at the Meadowbank Stadium sees two relegation candidates play each other, as bottom of the table Edinburgh City host seventh-placed Queen of the South.</p>
<p>Edinburgh have picked up 10 points from their first 10 League One games, with two wins and four draws.</p>
<p>That is 18 points less than the Doonhamers have collected, having won eight and drawn four.</p>
<p>Edinburgh are in terrible form in League One, with no wins and a draw from their last six games.</p>
<p>With two wins and two draws over that period, Queen of the South's form is much better – they have taken eight points from 18, compared to City's one.</p>
