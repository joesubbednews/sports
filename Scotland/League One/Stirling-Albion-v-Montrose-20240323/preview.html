<p style="font-weight: bold;">Relegation candidates Stirling Albion face a challenge against high-flying Montrose at the Forthbank Stadium on Saturday.</p>
<p>Stirling Albion are seventh in the League One table, and have picked up eight wins and seven draws in their 29 games to date.</p>
<p>The Gable Endies, meanwhile, are fourth in the standings with 46 points, having won 13 and drawn seven, and are 29 points behind table-toppers Falkirk.</p>
<p>With 31 goals in 29 games so far this season, Stirling are the league's lowest scorers with 1.1 goals per game. And they are conceding at an average rate, letting in 46 goals at a rate of 1.6 per game.</p>
<p>Montrose, meanwhile, are above average scorers, with 1.8 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.6. They have conceded 1.5 goals per game.</p>

<p>In Blair Currie, Albion can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept eight clean sheets in his 29 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Falkirk's Sam Long – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in League One.</p>
<p>In the Gable Endies's net, Cameron Gill has five clean sheets in 29 games.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Stirling and Montrose have played each other on 18 occasions. They won eight each, and they drew twice.</p>
<p>On average, the Binos scored 1.6 goals and the Gable Endies 1.3 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on February 6, when Montrose won 2-0 away.</p>

<p>The Binos are in disappointing form in League One, with one win and two draws from their last six games.</p>
<p>With four wins and a draw over that period, the away side's form is much better – they have taken 13 points from 18, compared to the hosts' five.</p>
<p>Stirling's last match was on March 16, a 3-0 loss against Hamilton Academical.</p>
<p>Montrose drew 1-1 with Annan Athletic last time out, also on March 16, with Ali Shrive on the scoresheet.</p>
