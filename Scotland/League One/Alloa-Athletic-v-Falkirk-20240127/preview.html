<p style="font-weight: bold;">Two of League One's meanest defences go head-to-head at the Indodrill Stadium on Saturday, when Falkirk visit Alloa Athletic.</p>
<p>No teams have conceded fewer goals than Falkirk to date: the away side have let in just 13 goals in 21 games.</p>
<p>Alloa have conceded 28 goals in 19 games, giving them the joint-third tightest back line so far this season.</p>
<p>Key to the Bairns's home form has been Sam Long, who has allowed 0.67 goals past him per 90 minutes, compared to 1.2 for Peter Morrison in the opposite net.</p>
<p>Falkirk are top of the table after 21 games, of which they have won 16 and drawn five, earning 53 points.</p>
<p>Alloa are four places behind the Bairns in fifth, with seven wins and five draws putting them on 26 points.</p>

<p>In Callumn Morrison, the visitors have one of the league's sharpest shooters so far this season. He has notched 11 goals in 18 appearances, to sit second in the scoring charts.</p>
<p>His goal rate of one every 133 minutes is slightly quicker than that of Alistair Roy, Athletic's top scorer with a goal every 104 minutes, and a total of five goals in eight games.</p>
<p>The home side are in mixed form in League One, with two wins and three draws from their last six games.</p>
<p>With five wins and a draw over that period, Falkirk's form is much better – they have taken 16 points from 18, compared to Alloa's nine.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Alloa and Falkirk have played each other on 25 occasions. Alloa won four of them, Falkirk 17, and they drew four times.</p>
<p>On average, Alloa scored 1.0 goals and the Bairns 2.0 in those matches.</p>
