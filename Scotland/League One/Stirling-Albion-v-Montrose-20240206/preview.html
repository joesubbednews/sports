<div class="story-inner">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Montrose travel to the Forthbank Stadium looking to secure a first win in six League One games against Stirling Albion on late Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Gable Endies have lost one and drawn four matches since they last earned three points – against Kelty Hearts on December 16.</p>
<p>They face a Stirling side who have won two and drawn two over that time.</p>
<p>In Blair Currie, Stirling can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept six clean sheets in his 21 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Falkirk's Sam Long – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in League One.</p>
<p>In Montrose's net, Cameron Gill has three clean sheets in 21 games.</p>
<p>With 23 goals in 21 games so far this season, Albion are the league's lowest scorers with 1.1 goals per game. And they are conceding more than average, letting in 34 goals at a rate of 1.6 per game.</p>

<p>The Gable Endies are also below average scorers, with 1.4 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.5. They have conceded 1.5 goals per game.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Stirling and Montrose have played each other on 18 occasions. Stirling won eight of them, Montrose seven, and they drew three times.</p>
<p>On average, the Binos scored 1.7 goals and the Gable Endies 1.3 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on January 13, when Stirling won 1-0 away.</p>
<p>The Binos are eighth in the table after 21 games, of which they have won seven and drawn five, earning 26 points.</p>

<p>The visitors are three places ahead of the home side in fifth, with seven wins and six draws putting them on 27 points.</p>
<p>Stirling's last match was on Saturday, a 2-2 draw against Cove Rangers, with Dale Carrick getting the goals for the Binos.</p>
<p>Montrose drew 1-1 with Hamilton Academical last time out, on January 27, with Luke Graham on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>Tuesday's match will be refereed by Steven Kirkland, who has taken charge of five League One games so far this season, issuing no red cards and booking 26 players. He has awarded four penalties. </p>
<p>The last Montrose game Kirkland refereed was the 2-1 win at home against Alloa Athletic on October 7. He is yet to oversee a match featuring Stirling this season.</p>
