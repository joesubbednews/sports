<p style="font-weight: bold;">Alloa Athletic host Queen of the South in Saturday's match at the Indodrill Stadium looking to bounce back from defeat last time out in League One.</p>
<p>Alloa, who sit third in the league after 29 games, fell to a 2-1 away defeat to Kelty Hearts on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The last Alloa game Muir refereed was a 1-0 home loss to Stirling Albion on August 12. He is yet to oversee a match featuring Queen of the South this season.</p>
