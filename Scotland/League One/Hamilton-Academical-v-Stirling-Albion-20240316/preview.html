<div class="story-inner">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Two of League One's meanest defences go head-to-head at the Fountain of Youth Stadium on Saturday, when Hamilton Academical host Stirling Albion.</p>
<p>Only one side – Falkirk – has conceded fewer goals than Hamilton Academical to date: the home side have let in just 22 goals in 28 games.</p>
<p>The Binos have conceded 43 goals in 28 games, giving them the joint-fourth tightest back line so far this season.</p>
<p>Key to the Accies's home form has been Jamie Smith, who has allowed 0.96 goals past him per 90 minutes, compared to 1.46 for Blair Currie in the opposite net.</p>
<p>Hamilton Academical are second in the table after 28 games, of which they have won 16 and drawn seven, earning 55 points.</p>

<p>Stirling are four places behind the Accies in sixth, with eight wins and seven draws putting them on 31 points.</p>
<p>In Kevin O'Hara, the hosts have one of the league's sharpest shooters so far this season. He has notched 11 goals in 28 appearances, to sit third in the scoring charts.</p>
<p>His goal rate of one every 197 minutes is quicker than that of Dale Carrick, Albion's top scorer with a goal every 252 minutes, and a total of eight goals in 26 games.</p>
<p>Hamilton Academical are in mixed form in League One, with two wins and a draw from their last six games.</p>
<p>With a win and two draws over that period, the Binos' form is slightly worse – they have taken five points from 18, compared to Hamilton Academical's seven.</p>
