<p style="font-weight: bold;">Edinburgh University host Albion Rovers in Saturday's match at East Peffermill looking to bounce back from defeat last time out in Highland and Lowland Football Leagues.</p>
<p>Edinburgh University, who sit zero in the league after 16 games, fell to a 4-0 home defeat to Hearts U21 on November 11.</p>
<p>They face an Albion side who picked up a win in their last match, a 2-1 victory against Edusport Academy, and who sit zero in the table.</p>
<p>With 11 goals in 16 games so far this season, Edinburgh University are the league's-16th-lowest scorers with 0.7 goals per game. And they are conceding more than average, letting in 63 goals at a rate of 3.9 per game.</p>
