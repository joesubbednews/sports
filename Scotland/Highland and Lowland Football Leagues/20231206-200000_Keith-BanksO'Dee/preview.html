<p style="font-weight: bold;">Keith host Banks O' Dee in Wednesday's late match at Kynoch Park looking to bounce back from defeat last time out in Highland and Lowland Football Leagues.</p>
<p>Keith, who sit zero in the league after 12 games, fell to a 3-1 away defeat to Brechin City on November 22.</p>
<p>They face a Banks O' Dee side who picked up a win in their last match, a 4-1 victory against Strathspey Thistle, and who sit fourth in the table.</p>
<p>With 42 goals in 16 games so far this season, Banks O' Dee are the league's third-highest scorers with 2.6 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 14 goals at a rate of 0.9 per game.</p>

<p>Keith, meanwhile, are below average scorers, with 1.2 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.7. They have conceded 1.8 goals per game.</p>
