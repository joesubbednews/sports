<p style="font-weight: bold;">East Stirlingshire host Albion Rovers in Saturday's match at the Falkirk Community Stadium looking to bounce back from defeat last time out in Highland and Lowland Football Leagues.</p>
<p>The Shire, who sit zero in the league after 18 games, fell to a 1-0 away defeat to Stirling University on December 9.</p>
<p>They face an Albion side who picked up a win in their last match, a 2-0 victory against Edinburgh University, and who sit zero in the table.</p>
