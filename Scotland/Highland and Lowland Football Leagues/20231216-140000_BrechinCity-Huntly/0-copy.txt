Huntly face a challenge to maintain their high-scoring form away against a tight Brechin City defence on Saturday.
With 44 goals in 15 games, Huntly are the third-highest scorers in Highland and Lowland Football Leagues ahead of the 2pm kick-off at Glebe Park.
They face a Brechin side who have scored 35 in 14 matches, but conceded only 10 goals, putting them joint-top of the league's tightest defences.
Brechin are fifth in the table after 14 games, of which they have won 11 and drawn one, earning 34 points.
Huntly are seven places behind City in 12th, with eight wins and three draws putting them on 27 points.
The hosts are in reasonable form in Highland and Lowland Football Leagues, with four wins and two losses from their last six games.
With a win and two draws over that period, the away team's form is much worse â€“ they have taken five points from 18, compared to Brechin's 12.
Brechin's last match was on Saturday, a 4-3 loss against Formartine United, with Ewan Loudon (two) and Marc Scott getting the goals for Brechin.
Huntly drew 4-4 with Rothes last time out, also on Saturday, with Angus Grant (two), Andy Hunter and Lewis Crosbie on the scoresheet.
