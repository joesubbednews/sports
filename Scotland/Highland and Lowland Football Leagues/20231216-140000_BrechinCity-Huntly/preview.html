<p style="font-weight: bold;">Huntly face a challenge to maintain their high-scoring form away against a tight Brechin City defence on Saturday.</p>
<p>With 44 goals in 15 games, Huntly are the third-highest scorers in Highland and Lowland Football Leagues ahead of the 2pm kick-off at Glebe Park.</p>
<p>They face a Brechin side who have scored 35 in 14 matches, but conceded only 10 goals, putting them joint-top of the league's tightest defences.</p>
<p>Brechin are fifth in the table after 14 games, of which they have won 11 and drawn one, earning 34 points.</p>
<p>Huntly are seven places behind City in 12th, with eight wins and three draws putting them on 27 points.</p>

<p>The hosts are in reasonable form in Highland and Lowland Football Leagues, with four wins and two losses from their last six games.</p>
<p>With a win and two draws over that period, the away team's form is much worse – they have taken five points from 18, compared to Brechin's 12.</p>
<p>Brechin's last match was on Saturday, a 4-3 loss against Formartine United, with Ewan Loudon (two) and Marc Scott getting the goals for Brechin.</p>
<p>Huntly drew 4-4 with Rothes last time out, also on Saturday, with Angus Grant (two), Andy Hunter and Lewis Crosbie on the scoresheet.</p>
