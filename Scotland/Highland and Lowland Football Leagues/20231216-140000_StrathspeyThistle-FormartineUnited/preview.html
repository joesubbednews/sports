<p style="font-weight: bold;">Strathspey Thistle host Formartine United in Saturday's early match at Seafield Park looking to bounce back from defeat last time out in Highland and Lowland Football Leagues.</p>
<p>Strathspey Thistle, who sit zero in the league after 16 games, fell to a 2-0 home defeat to Forres Mechanics on December 9.</p>
<p>They face a Formartine side who picked up a win in their last match, a 4-3 victory against Brechin City, and who sit seventh in the table.</p>
