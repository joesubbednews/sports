<p>Their last meeting was on January 6, when Elgin won 2-1 at home.</p>

<p>Stranraer are in mixed form in League Two, with two wins and a draw from their last six games.</p>
<p>With two wins and two draws over that period, the Black & Whites' form is slightly better – they have taken eight points from 18, compared to Stranraer's seven.</p>
<p>Saturday's match will be refereed by Duncan Williams, who has taken charge of nine League Two games so far this season, issuing two red cards and booking 42 players. He has awarded four penalties. </p>
<p>The last Elgin game Williams refereed was the 2-2 draw at home against Stenhousemuir on February 17. He is yet to oversee a match featuring Stranraer this season.</p>
