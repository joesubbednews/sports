<p>His goal rate of one every 165 minutes is quicker than that of Tony Wallace, Dumbarton's top scorer with a goal every 193 minutes, and a total of nine goals in 28 games.</p>

<p>In the last three years, Spartans and Dumbarton have played each other on three occasions. Spartans won one of them and they drew the other.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on February 13, when they played out a 0-0 draw.</p>
<p>Saturday's match will be refereed by Steven Kirkland, who has taken charge of three League Two games so far this season, issuing three red cards and booking 13 players. He has not awarded any penalties. </p>
<p>The last Spartans game Kirkland refereed was a 2-1 away win against Clyde on November 4. He is yet to oversee a match featuring Dumbarton this season.</p>
