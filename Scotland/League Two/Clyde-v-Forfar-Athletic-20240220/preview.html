<p style="font-weight: bold;">Struggling Clyde face Forfar Athletic at the Fountain of Youth Stadium on Tuesday looking to build on a win in their last league outing.</p>
<p>After securing all three points with a 2-0 victory over Dumbarton on Saturday, the Bully Wee sit bottom of League Two.</p>
<p>They travel to play a Forfar side eighth in the standings, who were held in their last match, 3-3 against Peterhead.</p>
<p>With Marc McCallum between the sticks, Forfar can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept eight clean sheets in his 24 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Stenhousemuir's Darren Jamieson – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in League Two.</p>
<p>In Clyde's net, Jack Leighfield has one clean sheet in 19 games. He has conceded a goal every 48 minutes, 50% more often than the 72 minutes between goals for McCallum.</p>
<iframe src="1-match-odds.html" title="Clyde v Forfar Athletic match odds" height="120" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
<p>In the last 10 years, Clyde and Forfar have played each other on 12 occasions. Clyde won two of them, Forfar five, and they drew five times.</p>
<p>On average, the Bully Wee scored 1.2 goals and the Loons 1.3 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on November 11, when they played out a 1-1 draw.</p>
<p>With 26 goals in 24 games so far this season, Athletic are the league's second-lowest scorers with 1.1 goals per game. And they are conceding at an average rate, letting in 31 goals at a rate of 1.3 per game.</p>
<p>The Bully Wee are also below average scorers, with 1.1 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.3. They have conceded 1.8 goals per game.</p>

<p>The hosts are in disappointing form in League Two, with one win and three draws from their last six games.</p>
<p>With two wins and three draws over that period, the Loons' form is better – they have taken nine points from 18, compared to Clyde's six.</p>
<p>Tuesday's match will be refereed by Scott Lambie, who has taken charge of one League Two game so far this season, issuing no red cards and booking two players. He has awarded three penalties. </p>
<p>He is yet to oversee a match featuring either Clyde or Forfar this season.</p>
