<p>With 37 goals in 22 games so far this season, Peterhead are the league's second-highest scorers with 1.7 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 24 goals at a rate of 1.1 per game.</p>
<p>Clyde, meanwhile, are below average scorers, with 1.1 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.4. They have conceded 2.0 goals per game.</p>
