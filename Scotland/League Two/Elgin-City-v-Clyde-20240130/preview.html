<div class="story-inner">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Tuesday's late match at Borough Briggs sees the league's two bottom sides face each other, as Elgin City host rock-bottom Clyde.</p>
<p>Elgin have picked up 18 points from their first 18 League Two games, with five wins and three draws.</p>
<p>That is four points more than the Bully Wee have collected, having won two and drawn eight.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Elgin and Clyde have played each other on 23 occasions. Elgin won nine of them, Clyde 12, and they drew twice.</p>
<p>On average, the Black & Whites scored 1.3 goals and the Bully Wee 1.7 in those matches.</p>

<p>Their last meeting was on September 23, when Clyde won 2-1 at home.</p>
<p>In Tom McHale, Elgin can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept four clean sheets in his 19 appearances this season in League Two.</p>
<p>In Clyde's net, Jack Leighfield has one clean sheet in 18 games. He has conceded a goal every 48 minutes, 20% more often than the 57 minutes between goals for McHale.</p>
<p>City are in disappointing form in League Two, with two wins and four losses from their last six games.</p>
<p>With a win and three draws over that period, the Bully Wee's form is similar – they have both taken six points from 18.</p>

<p>With 16 goals in 20 games so far this season, the Black & Whites are the league's lowest scorers with 0.8 goals per game. And they are conceding more than average, letting in 37 goals at a rate of 1.9 per game.</p>
<p>The visitors are also below average scorers, with 1.1 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.4. They have conceded 2.0 goals per game.</p>
<p>Elgin's last match was on Saturday, a 1-0 loss against Dumbarton.</p>
<p>Clyde drew 1-1 with Spartans last time out, also on Saturday, with Jordan Allan on the scoresheet.</p>
