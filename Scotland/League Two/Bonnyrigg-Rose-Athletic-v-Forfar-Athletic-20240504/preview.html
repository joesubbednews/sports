<p style="font-weight: bold;">Bonnyrigg Rose Athletic host Forfar Athletic on Saturday at New Dundas Park in League Two.</p>
<p>In their last league match, on April 27, Bonnyrigg Rose drew with Stenhousemuir 1-1 away, with their goal scored by Bradley Barrett.</p>
<p>Forfar won, 2-0 at home against Stranraer, with Mark Whatley and Stuart Morrison on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>With Marc McCallum between the sticks, Forfar can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 11 clean sheets in his 35 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Stenhousemuir's Darren Jamieson – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in League Two.</p>
<p>In Bonnyrigg Rose's net, Paddy Martin has six clean sheets in 35 games. He has conceded a goal every 67 minutes, 20% more often than the 79 minutes between goals for McCallum.</p>
