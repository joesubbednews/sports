<p style="font-weight: bold;">Sunday's match between Hearts Women and Celtic Women promises to be one for the neutrals, as two of SWPL 1's most free-scoring sides go head-to-head. </p>
<p> Ahead of the game at Oriam National Performance Centre, Hearts and Celtic sit third and top in the goal-scoring charts, with 41 and 80 goals respectively. </p>

<p> And Amy Gallagher has been the main man in the opponents' penalty box for Celtic, with 16 goals.</p>
<p>In Kelsey Daugherty, Celtic can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept seven clean sheets in her 11 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in SWPL 1. </p>
<p> In Hearts' net, Lisa Maher-Rodgers has two clean sheets in three games. She has conceded a goal every 90 minutes, 60% more often than the 141 minutes between goals for Daugherty.</p>
