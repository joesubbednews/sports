<p style="font-weight: bold;">Rangers Women host Glasgow City Women in Sunday's match at the Broadwood Stadium looking to bounce back from defeat last time out in SWPL 1. </p>
<p> Rangers, who sit top of the league after 24 games, fell to a 1-2 home defeat to Hibernian Women on March 31. </p>
<p> They face a Glasgow City side who also lost their last match, a 2-1 defeat to Celtic Women, and who sit third in the table.</p>
<p>With 95 goals in 24 games so far this season, Rangers are the league's second-highest scorers with 4.0 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 13 goals at a rate of 0.5 per game.  </p>
<p> Glasgow City are also above average scorers, with 3.1 goals per game, compared to a league average of 2.1. They have conceded 0.6 goals per game.</p>
<p>With Jenna Fife between the sticks, the hosts can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept 10 clean sheets in her 20 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in SWPL 1. </p>

<p> In the away team's net, Lee Alexander has eight clean sheets in 16 games. She has conceded a goal every 131 minutes, 30% more often than the 164 minutes between goals for Fife.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Rangers and Glasgow City have played each other on 12 occasions. Rangers won four of them, Glasgow City three, and they drew five times. </p>
<p> On average, Rangers scored 1.2 goals and Glasgow City 0.8 in those matches. </p>
<p> Their last meeting was on November 19, when Rangers won 2-0 away.</p>
<p>Rangers are in reasonable form in SWPL 1, with three wins and two draws from their last six games. </p>
<p> With five wins and one loss over that period, Glasgow City's form is better – they have taken 15 points from 18, compared to Rangers's 11.</p>
