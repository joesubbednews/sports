<p style="font-weight: bold;">Hibernian Women face a challenge to maintain their high-scoring form away against a tight Hearts Women defence on Friday. </p>
<p> With 63 goals in 24 games, Hibernian are the fourth-highest scorers in SWPL 1 ahead of the 7.30pm kick-off at Oriam National Performance Centre. </p>
<p> They face a Hearts side who have scored 61 in 24 matches, but conceded only 24 goals, putting them fourth among the league's tightest defences – only Rangers Women, Celtic Women and Glasgow City Women have conceded fewer goals.</p>
<p>In Jorian Baucom, Hibernian have one of the league's sharpest shooters so far this season. She has notched 21 goals in 24 appearances, to sit second in the scoring charts. </p>
<p> Her goal rate of one every 86 minutes is quicker than that of Katie Jayne Lockwood, Hearts's top scorer with a goal every 105 minutes, and a total of 14 goals in 17 games.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Hearts and Hibernian have played each other on 12 occasions. Hearts won two of them, Hibernian seven, and they drew three times. </p>
<p> On average, Hearts scored 0.8 goals and Hibs 2.1 in those matches. </p>

<p> Their last meeting was on November 18, when Hibernian won 2-1 at home.</p>
<p>The hosts are fourth in the table after 24 games, of which they have won 14 and drawn three, earning 45 points. </p>
<p> Hibs are one place behind Hearts in fifth, with 13 wins and three draws putting them on 42 points.</p>
<p>Hearts are in reasonable form in SWPL 1, with four wins and two losses from their last six games. </p>
<p> With two wins and a draw over that period, the away side's form is worse – they have taken seven points from 18, compared to the home team's 12.</p>
<p>Hearts's last match was on March 31, a 3-0 win against Partick Thistle Women, with Kathleen Mary McGovern (two) and Dannielle Collean McGinley getting the goals for Hearts. </p>
<p> Hibernian lost 2-1 against Rangers Women last time out, also on March 31, with Baucom on the scoresheet.</p>
