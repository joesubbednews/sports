<p style="font-weight: bold;">Hibernian Women travel to Aberdeen on early Saturday in SWPL 1. </p>
<p> The visitors come into the game on the back of a defeat in their last match, having lost to Glasgow City Women 3-1 at home, with a goal from Leah Eddie. </p>
<p> Aberdeen, meanwhile, drew their last match, 1-1 against Hamilton Academical, with their goal scored by Chloe Gover.</p>
<p>With 26 goals in 15 games so far this season, Aberdeen are scoring at below the league average rate with 1.7 goals per game. And they are conceding more than average, letting in 45 goals at a rate of 3.0 per game.  </p>
<p> Hibernian, meanwhile, are above average scorers, with 2.5 goals per game, compared to a league average of 2.2. They have conceded 1.7 goals per game.</p>
<p>With Katie Fraine between the sticks, Hibs can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept five clean sheets in her 13 appearances this season, and only two other 'keepers – Celtic Women's Kelsey Daugherty and Rangers Women's Jenna Fife – have been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in SWPL 1. </p>
<p> In the home team's net, Faye Mary Kirby has two clean sheets in seven games. She has conceded a goal every 55 minutes, 10% more often than the 62 minutes between goals for Fraine.</p>
