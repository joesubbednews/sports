<p style="font-weight: bold;">Hearts Women face a challenge to maintain their high-scoring form away against a tight Partick Thistle Women defence on Sunday. </p>
<p> With 37 goals in 14 games, Hearts are the joint-third-highest scorers in SWPL 1 ahead of the 1pm kick-off at Petershill Park. </p>
<p> They face a Thistle side who have scored 27 in 14 matches, but conceded only 17 goals, putting them fourth among the league's tightest defences – only Rangers Women, Celtic Women and Glasgow City Women have conceded fewer goals.</p>
<p>Partick Thistle are in fantastic form in SWPL 1, with five wins and one loss from their last six games. </p>
<p> With three wins and two draws over that period, Hearts' form is worse – they have taken 11 points from 18, compared to Thistle's 15.</p>
<p>With Megan Cunningham between the sticks, the hosts can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept four clean sheets in her nine appearances this season in SWPL 1. </p>
<p> In the away team's net, Lisa Maher-Rodgers has two clean sheets in three games.</p>
