<p>In Kelsey Daugherty, the away team can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept 11 clean sheets in her 23 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in SWPL 1. </p>
<p> In the hosts' net, Jenna Fife has 10 clean sheets in 22 games.</p>
<p>Rangers are in reasonable form in SWPL 1, with four wins and two losses from their last six games. </p>
<p> With five wins and a draw over that period, Celtic's form is better – they have taken 16 points from 18, compared to Rangers's 12.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Rangers and Celtic have played each other on 15 occasions. They won six each, and they drew three times. </p>
