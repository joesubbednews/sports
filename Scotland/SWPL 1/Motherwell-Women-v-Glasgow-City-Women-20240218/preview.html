<p>In Lee Alexander, the away team can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept six clean sheets in her 12 appearances this season, and only two other 'keepers – Rangers Women's Jenna Fife and Celtic Women's Kelsey Daugherty – have been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in SWPL 1. </p>
<p> In the hosts' net, Emily Mutch has four clean sheets in 19 games. She has conceded a goal every 36 minutes, four times as often as the 135 minutes between goals for Alexander.</p>
<p>Glasgow City are third in the table after 20 games, of which they have won 16 and drawn two, earning 50 points. </p>
<p> Motherwell are five places behind Glasgow City in eighth, with five wins and one draw putting them on 16 points.</p>
<p>Motherwell's last match was on February 11, a 2-1 loss against Hamilton Academical. </p>
<p> Glasgow City beat Montrose Women 5-1 last time out, also on February 11, with Fiona Brown (two), Carlee Giammona, Kenzie Weir and Mairead Fulton on the scoresheet.</p>
