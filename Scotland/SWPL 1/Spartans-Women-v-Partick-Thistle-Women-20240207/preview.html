<p>With 18 goals in 18 games so far this season, the hosts are scoring at below the league average rate with 1.0 goals per game. And they are conceding more than average, letting in 51 goals at a rate of 2.8 per game.  </p>
<p> Thistle are also below average scorers, with 1.8 goals per game, compared to a league average of 2.2. They have conceded 1.6 goals per game.</p>
<p>With Megan Cunningham between the sticks, the away side can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept five clean sheets in her 12 appearances this season in SWPL 1. </p>
<p> In Spartans's net, Alicia Yates has two clean sheets in 12 games. She has conceded a goal every 36 minutes, 50% more often than the 53 minutes between goals for Cunningham.</p>
<p>Spartans's last match was on January 28, a 1-0 loss against Hearts Women. </p>
<p> Partick Thistle beat Montrose Women 2-1 last time out, also on January 28, with Cara Henderson on the scoresheet.</p>
