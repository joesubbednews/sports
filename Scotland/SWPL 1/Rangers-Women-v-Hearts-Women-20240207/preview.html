<div class="story-inner">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Two of SWPL 1's meanest defences go head-to-head at the Broadwood Stadium on Wednesday, when Rangers Women host Hearts Women. </p>
<p> No teams have conceded fewer goals than Rangers to date: the home side have let in just nine goals in 18 games. </p>
<p> Hearts have conceded 21 goals in 18 games, giving them the fourth tightest back line so far this season. </p>
<p> Key to Rangers's home form has been Jenna Fife, who has allowed 0.5 goals past him per 90 minutes, compared to 1.2 for Charlotte Parker-Smith in the opposite net.</p>
<p>Rangers are top of the table after 18 games, of which they have won 17 and drawn one, earning 52 points. </p>
<p> Hearts are four places behind the home team in fifth, with 10 wins and three draws putting them on 33 points.</p>
<p>Rangers are in exceptional form in SWPL 1, with six wins and no losses from their last six games. </p>
<p> With four wins and a draw over that period, the visitors' form is worse – they have taken 13 points from 18, compared to Rangers's 18.</p>
