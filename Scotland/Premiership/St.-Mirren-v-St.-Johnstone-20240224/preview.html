<p style="font-weight: bold;">St. Johnstone make the journey to the SMISA Stadium to play St. Mirren on Saturday looking to pick up points to end their three-game losing streak.</p>

<p>In the last 10 years, St. Mirren and St. Johnstone have played each other on 24 occasions. St. Mirren won six of them, St. Johnstone 11, and they drew seven times.</p>
<p>On average, the Buddies scored 0.8 goals and the Saints 1.0 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on December 6, when St. Johnstone won 1-0 at home.</p>

<p>St. Mirren are five places ahead of the Saints in fifth, with 10 wins and five draws putting them on 35 points.</p>

<p>Saturday's match will be refereed by Grant Irvine, who has taken charge of six Premiership games so far this season, issuing two red cards and booking 15 players. He has awarded three penalties. </p>
<p>The last St. Mirren game Irvine refereed was a 3-0 away win against Aberdeen on December 30. He is yet to oversee a match featuring St. Johnstone this season.</p>
