<p style="font-weight: bold;">Wednesday's late match between Dundee and Rangers promises to be one for the neutrals, as two of the Premiership's most free-scoring sides go head-to-head.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game at Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park, the Dees and Rangers sit fourth and second in the goal-scoring charts, with 44 and 70 goals respectively.</p>
<p>Midfielder Luke McCowan leads the way for the home side, having bagged nine goals in their 31 games to date.</p>
<p>And James Tavernier has been the main man in the opponents' penalty box for Rangers, with 16 goals.</p>
<p>With Jack Butland between the sticks, Rangers can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 17 clean sheets in his 31 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in the Premiership.</p>
<p>In Dundee's net, Trevor Carson has eight clean sheets in 25 games. He has conceded a goal every 56 minutes, more than twice as often as the 140 minutes between goals for Butland.</p>
