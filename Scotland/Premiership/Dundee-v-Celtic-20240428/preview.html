<p style="font-weight: bold;">Celtic travel to Dundee on Sunday in the Premiership.</p>
<p>The visitors come into the game on the back of a win in their last match, having beaten St. Mirren 3-0 at home, with goals from Kyogo Furuhashi, Adam Uche Idah and Reo Hatate.</p>
<p>The Dees, meanwhile, drew their last match, 0-0 against Rangers.</p>
<p>With 80 goals in 33 games so far this season, Celtic are the league's highest scorers with 2.4 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 26 goals at a rate of 0.8 per game.</p>
<p>Dundee, meanwhile, are average scorers, with 1.3 goals per game. They have conceded 1.6 goals per game.</p>
<p>The Bhoys are top of the table after 33 games, of which they have won 24 and drawn six, earning 78 points.</p>
<p>The Dees are five places behind the visitors in sixth, with 10 wins and 11 draws putting them on 41 points.</p>

<p>In the last 10 years, Dundee and Celtic have played each other on 23 occasions. Celtic won 19 of them and they drew four times.</p>
<p>On average, the Dees scored 0.4 goals and the Bhoys 2.7 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on February 28, when Celtic won 7-1 at home.</p>
<p>In Joe Hart, Celtic can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 13 clean sheets in his 32 appearances this season, and only two other 'keepers – Rangers's Jack Butland and Hearts's Zander Clark – have been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in the Premiership.</p>
<p>In the home team's net, Trevor Carson has eight clean sheets in 25 games. He has conceded a goal every 56 minutes, more than twice as often as the 134 minutes between goals for Hart.</p>
<p>Dundee are in mixed form in the Premiership, with two wins and three draws from their last six games.</p>
<p>With four wins and a draw over that period, Celtic's form is better – they have taken 13 points from 18, compared to Dundee's nine.</p>
