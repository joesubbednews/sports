<p style="font-weight: bold;">Rangers travel to St. Mirren on Sunday lunchtime in the Premiership.</p>
<p>The visitors come into the game on the back of a draw in their last match, having tied with Dundee 0-0 away.</p>
<p>The Buddies, meanwhile, lost their last match, 3-0 against Celtic.</p>
<p>With 72 goals in 33 games so far this season, Rangers are the league's second-highest scorers with 2.2 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 23 goals at a rate of 0.7 per game.</p>
<p>St. Mirren, meanwhile, are below average scorers, with 1.2 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.3. They have conceded 1.3 goals per game.</p>
<p>With Jack Butland between the sticks, the visitors can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 18 clean sheets in his 33 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in the Premiership.</p>
<p>In the Buddies's net, Zachary Hemming has 10 clean sheets in 33 games. He has conceded a goal every 74 minutes, 70% more often than the 129 minutes between goals for Butland.</p>
