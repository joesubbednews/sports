<div class="story-inner">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">The Premiership's top two sides face each other at the Ibrox Stadium in Sunday lunchtime's kick-off, when second-placed Rangers host Celtic.</p>
<p>Rangers have picked up 24 wins and one draw from 30 games so far this season, and sit one point below the visitors going into the 12pm match.</p>
<p>The Bhoys, meanwhile, have won 23 and drawn five of 31, picking up 74 points.</p>
<p>With 74 goals in 31 games so far this season, Celtic are the league's highest scorers with 2.4 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 23 goals at a rate of 0.7 per game.</p>
<p>Rangers are also above average scorers, with 2.2 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.3. They have conceded 0.6 goals per game.</p>
<p>With Jack Butland between the sticks, the home team can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 17 clean sheets in his 30 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in the Premiership.</p>
