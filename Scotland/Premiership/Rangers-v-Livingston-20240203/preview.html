<p style="font-weight: bold;">Relegation candidates Livingston face a challenge away against high-flying Rangers at the Ibrox Stadium on Saturday.</p>
<p>Livingston are rooted to the bottom of the Premiership table, and have picked up just two wins and seven draws in their 23 games to date.</p>
<p>Rangers, meanwhile, are second in the standings with 52 points, having won 17 and drawn one of their first 22 matches, and are five points behind table-toppers Celtic.</p>
<p>With 45 goals in 22 games so far this season, Rangers are the league's second-highest scorers with 2.0 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 11 goals at a rate of 0.5 per game.</p>
<p>Livingston, meanwhile, are below average scorers, with 0.7 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.3. They have conceded 1.7 goals per game.</p>
<p>With Jack Butland between the sticks, the hosts can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 14 clean sheets in his 22 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in Premiership.</p>
