<p style="font-weight: bold;">Relegation candidates St. Johnstone face a challenge against high-flying Rangers at McDiarmid Park on Sunday.</p>

<p>Rangers, meanwhile, are top of the standings with 61 points, having won 20 and drawn one.</p>
<p>St. Johnstone are in disappointing form in the Premiership, with one win and three draws from their last six games.</p>

<p>The hosts, meanwhile, are below average scorers, with 0.7 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.3. They have conceded 1.3 goals per game.</p>
