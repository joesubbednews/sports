<p>With 53 goals in 22 games so far this season, Celtic are the league's highest scorers with 2.4 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 15 goals at a rate of 0.7 per game.</p>
<p>Ross, meanwhile, are below average scorers, with 0.9 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.3. They have conceded 1.5 goals per game.</p>

<p>Ross lost 3-0 against Aberdeen last time out, also on January 2.</p>

<p>The last Ross game Anderson refereed was the 1-1 draw at home against Livingston on September 16. He is yet to oversee a match featuring Celtic this season.</p>
