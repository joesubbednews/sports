<p style="font-weight: bold;">Kilmarnock host Hibernian in Saturday's match at the BBSP Stadium Rugby Park looking to bounce back from defeat last time out in Premiership.</p>
<p>Killies, who sit fourth in the league after 22 games, fell to a 3-1 away defeat to Rangers on January 2.</p>
<p>They face a Hibernian side who also lost their last match, a 3-0 defeat to Rangers, and who sit sixth in the table.</p>
<p>With 24 goals in 22 games so far this season, Kilmarnock are scoring at below the league average rate with 1.1 goals per game. But they are conceding fewer than average too, letting in 23 goals at a rate of 1.0 per game.</p>
<p>Hibernian are also below average scorers, with 1.2 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.3. They have conceded 1.5 goals per game.</p>

<p>In the last 10 years, Kilmarnock and Hibernian have played each other on 23 occasions. Kilmarnock won five of them, Hibernian 11, and they drew seven times.</p>
<p>On average, Killies scored 1.0 goal and Hibs 1.4 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on November 11, when Hibernian won 1-0 at home.</p>
<p>Killies are in reasonable form in Premiership, with three wins and two draws from their last six games.</p>
<p>With a win and a draw over that period, Hibs's form is much worse – they have taken four points from 18, compared to the hosts' 11.</p>

<p>In Will Dennis, Kilmarnock can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept eight clean sheets in his 22 appearances this season in Premiership.</p>
<p>In the away side's net, David Marshall has seven clean sheets in 20 games. He has conceded a goal every 67 minutes, 50% more often than the 102 minutes between goals for Dennis.</p>
<p>Saturday's match will be refereed by Grant Irvine, who has taken charge of five Premiership games so far this season, issuing one red card and booking 12 players. He has awarded three penalties. </p>
<p>The last Hibernian game Irvine refereed was the 1-0 win away at Livingston on December 9. He is yet to oversee a match featuring Kilmarnock this season.</p>
