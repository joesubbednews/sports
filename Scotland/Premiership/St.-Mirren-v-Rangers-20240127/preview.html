<p style="font-weight: bold;">Rangers are strong favourites to take all three points despite St. Mirren's home advantage in Saturday lunchtime's match at the SMISA Stadium.</p>
<p>*Betting Company* are offering odds of 1.36 on Rangers sealing the win, with the visitors sitting second in Premiership table.</p>
<p>St. Mirren, who are fifth in the league and 20 points behind Rangers, are priced at 7.5 to win. A draw is set at 5.</p>
<p>With 44 goals in 21 games so far this season, Rangers are the league's second-highest scorers with 2.1 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 11 goals at a rate of 0.5 per game.</p>
<p>St. Mirren, meanwhile, are below average scorers, with 1.1 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.3. They have conceded 1.3 goals per game.</p>
<p>With Jack Butland between the sticks, the away team can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 13 clean sheets in his 21 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in Premiership.</p>

<p>On average, the Buddies scored 0.4 goals and Rangers 2.5 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on December 3, when Rangers won 2-0 at home.</p>
<p>The hosts are in mixed form in Premiership, with two wins and a draw from their last six games.</p>
