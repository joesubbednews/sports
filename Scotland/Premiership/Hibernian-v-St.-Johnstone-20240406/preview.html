<p style="font-weight: bold;">Hibernian are heavy favourites to keep all three points at home in Saturday's kick-off against St. Johnstone.</p>
<p>Hibs, who sit seventh in the Premiership with 31 games played, are priced at 1.5 to seal victory at the Easter Road Stadium.</p>
<p>Sitting three places and 10 points behind them in the table, St. Johnstone are 5.8 to win with *Betting Company*, while the draw is at 4.0.</p>
<p>With 22 goals in 31 games so far this season, St. Johnstone are the league's second-lowest scorers with 0.7 goals per game. And they are conceding more than average, letting in 43 goals at a rate of 1.4 per game.</p>
<p>Hibernian, meanwhile, are above average scorers, with 1.4 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.3. They have conceded 1.5 goals per game.</p>
