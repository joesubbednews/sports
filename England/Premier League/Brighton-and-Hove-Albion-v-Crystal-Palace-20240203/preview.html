<p style="font-weight: bold;">Brighton and Hove Albion are heavy favourites to keep all three points at home in Saturday's kick-off against Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>Sitting six places and eight points behind them in the table, Palace are 4.6 to win with *Betting Company*, while the draw is at 4.1.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Brighton and Palace have played each other on 14 occasions. Brighton won four of them, Palace three, and they drew seven times.</p>

<p>Their last meeting was on December 21, when they played out a 1-1 draw.</p>
<p>With 25 goals in 22 games so far this season, Palace are scoring at below the league average rate with 1.1 goals per game. And they are conceding at an average rate, letting in 36 goals at a rate of 1.6 per game.</p>
