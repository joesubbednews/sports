<p style="font-weight: bold;">Arsenal are heavy favourites to keep all three points at home in Friday's late kick-off against Chelsea.</p>
<p>The Gunners, who sit top of the Premier League with 28 games played, are priced at 1.6 to seal victory at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
<p>Sitting 10 places and 25 points behind them in the table, Chelsea are 5.5 to win with *Betting Company*, while the draw is at 4.0.</p>
<p>With 70 goals in 28 games so far this season, Arsenal are the league's highest scorers with 2.5 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 24 goals at a rate of 0.9 per game.</p>
<p>Chelsea are also above average scorers, with 1.7 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.6. They have also conceded 1.7 goals per game.</p>
<iframe src="1-match-odds.html" title="Arsenal v Chelsea match odds" height="120" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
<p>The Gunners are in exceptional form in the Premier League, with six wins and no losses from their last six games.</p>
<p>With two wins and two draws over that period, the Blues' form is much worse – they have taken eight points from 18, compared to the hosts' 18.</p>
<p>In David Raya, Arsenal can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept nine clean sheets in his 22 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in the Premier League.</p>
<p>In the away side's net, Robert Sánchez has three clean sheets in 16 games. He has conceded a goal every 65 minutes, 60% more often than the 104 minutes between goals for Raya Martin.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Arsenal and Chelsea have played each other on 28 occasions. Arsenal won 11 of them, Chelsea nine, and they drew eight times.</p>
