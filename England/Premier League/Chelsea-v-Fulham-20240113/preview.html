<p style="font-weight: bold;">Fulham travel to Chelsea on Saturday lunchtime in the Premier League.</p>
<p>The visitors come into the game on the back of a win in their last match, having beaten Arsenal 2-1 at home, with goals from Raúl Jiménez and Bobby Decordova-Reid.</p>
<p>The Blues also won their last match, 3-2 against Luton Town, with their goals scored by Cole Palmer and Noni Madueke.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Chelsea and Fulham have played each other on nine occasions. Chelsea won seven of them, Fulham one, and they drew once.</p>
<p>On average, the Blues scored 1.7 goals and the Cottagers 0.4 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on October 2, when Chelsea won 2-0 away.</p>
<p>With 28 goals in 20 games so far this season, Fulham are scoring at below the league average rate with 1.4 goals per game. And they are conceding more than average, letting in 35 goals at a rate of 1.8 per game.</p>

<p>Chelsea, meanwhile, are above average scorers, with 1.7 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.6. They have conceded 1.6 goals per game.</p>
<p>With Bernd Leno between the sticks, the Cottagers can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept five clean sheets in his 20 appearances this season in the Premier League.</p>
<p>In the Blues' net, Robert Sánchez has three clean sheets in 16 games.</p>
<p>The visitors are 14th in the table after 20 games, of which they have won seven and drawn three, earning 24 points.</p>
<p>The home team are four places ahead of Fulham in 10th, with eight wins and four draws putting them on 28 points.</p>
<p>Chelsea are in mixed form in the Premier League, with three wins and three losses from their last six games.</p>
<p>And also with three wins and three losses over that period, Fulham's form is identical – they have both taken nine points from 18.</p>
