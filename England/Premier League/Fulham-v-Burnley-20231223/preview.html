<p style="font-weight: bold;">Fulham are heavy favourites to keep all three points at home in Saturday's kick-off against Burnley.</p>
<p>The Cottagers, who sit 12th in the Premier League with 17 games played, are priced at 1.6 to seal victory at Craven Cottage.</p>
<p>Sitting seven places and 13 points behind them in the table, Burnley are 5.0 to win with *Betting Company*, while the draw is at 4.0.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Fulham and Burnley have played each other on seven occasions. Fulham won one of them, Burnley five, and they drew once.</p>
<p>On average, the Cottagers scored 1.3 goals and the Clarets 2.3 in those matches.</p>

<p>Their last meeting was on May 10 2021, when Burnley won 2-0 away.</p>
<p>Fulham are in mixed form in the Premier League, with three wins and three losses from their last six games.</p>
<p>With a win and a draw over that period, Burnley's form is worse – they have taken four points from 18, compared to the Cottagers' nine.</p>
<p>With Bernd Leno between the sticks, the home team can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept five clean sheets in his 17 appearances this season in the Premier League.</p>
<p>In the Clarets' net, James Trafford has one clean sheet in 17 games. He has conceded a goal every 45 minutes, 30% more often than the 59 minutes between goals for Leno.</p>

<p>With 16 goals in 17 games so far this season, the visitors are the league's second-lowest scorers with 0.9 goals per game. And they are conceding more than average, letting in 36 goals at a rate of 2.1 per game.</p>
<p>Fulham, meanwhile, are average scorers, with 1.5 goals per game. They have conceded 1.7 goals per game.</p>
<p>Fulham's last match was on December 16, a 3-0 loss against Newcastle United.</p>
<p>Burnley lost 2-0 against Everton last time out, also on Saturday.</p>
