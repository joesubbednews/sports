<p style="font-weight: bold;">Manchester United are strong favourites to take all three points despite Luton Town's home advantage in Sunday's match at Kenilworth Road.</p>
<p>*Betting Company* are offering odds of 1.8 on United sealing the win, with the visitors sitting sixth in the Premier League table.</p>
<p>Luton, who are 18th in the league and 21 points behind the Red Devils, are priced at 4 to win. A draw is set at 4.</p>
<p>In André Onana, United can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept seven clean sheets in his 24 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Everton's Jordan Pickford – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in the Premier League.</p>
<p>In Luton's net, Thomas Kaminski has two clean sheets in 23 games. He has conceded a goal every 49 minutes, 50% more often than the 72 minutes between goals for Onana Onana.</p>

<p>With 33 goals in 24 games so far this season, the Red Devils are scoring at below the league average rate with 1.4 goals per game. But they are conceding fewer than average too, letting in 33 goals at a rate of 1.4 per game.</p>
<p>Town are also below average scorers, with 1.4 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.6. They have conceded 2.0 goals per game.</p>
<p>The Hatters are in mixed form in the Premier League, with two wins and two draws from their last six games.</p>
<p>With four wins and a draw over that period, the visitors' form is better – they have taken 13 points from 18, compared to the home team's eight.</p>

<p>Luton's last match was on February 10, a 3-1 loss against Sheffield United, with Carlton Morris getting the goal for the Hatters.</p>
<p>United beat Aston Villa 2-1 last time out, on February 11, with Rasmus Højlund and Scott McTominay on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>Sunday's match will be refereed by David Coote, who has taken charge of 10 Premier League games so far this season, issuing three red cards and booking 49 players. He has awarded four penalties. </p>
<p>The last Luton game Coote refereed was a 4-1 away loss to Brighton and Hove Albion on August 12. He is yet to oversee a match featuring United this season.</p>
