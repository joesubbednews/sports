<p style="font-weight: bold;">Chelsea are heavy favourites to keep all three points at home in Sunday's early kick-off against Wolverhampton Wanderers.</p>

<p>Sitting one place and two points behind them in the table, Wolves are 4.8 to win with *Betting Company*, while the draw is at 4.0.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Chelsea and Wolves have played each other on 12 occasions. They won four each, and they drew four times.</p>
<p>On average, the Blues scored 1.5 goals and Wolves 1.0 in those matches.</p>
