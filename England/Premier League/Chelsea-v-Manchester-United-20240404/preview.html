<p style="font-weight: bold;">Chelsea face Manchester United on Thursday seeking to protect their long unbeaten run in the Premier League.</p>
<p>The Blues are unbeaten in five, with two wins and three draws, ahead of the 8.15pm kick-off.</p>
<p>They face an United team who have won two and drawn one over the same number of games.</p>
<p>In André Onana, United can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept eight clean sheets in his 29 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Arsenal's David Raya – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in the Premier League.</p>
<p>In Chelsea's net, Robert Sánchez has three clean sheets in 16 games. He has conceded a goal every 65 minutes, 20% more often than the 77 minutes between goals for Onana Onana.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Chelsea and United have played each other on 24 occasions. Chelsea won six of them, United eight, and they drew 10 times.</p>
<iframe src="1-match-odds.html" title="Chelsea v Manchester United match odds" height="120" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
<p>On average, the Blues scored 1.0 goals and the Red Devils 1.2 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on December 6, when United won 2-1 at home.</p>
<p>With 40 goals in 29 games so far this season, the Red Devils are scoring at below the league average rate with 1.4 goals per game. But they are conceding fewer than average too, letting in 40 goals at a rate of 1.4 per game.</p>
<p>The Blues, meanwhile, are above average scorers, with 1.8 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.6. They have conceded 1.7 goals per game.</p>
<p>The visitors are sixth in the table after 29 games, of which they have won 15 and drawn three, earning 48 points.</p>

<p>The home team are six places behind United in 12th, with 11 wins and seven draws putting them on 40 points.</p>
<p>Chelsea's last match was on Saturday, a 2-2 draw against Burnley, with Cole Palmer getting the goals for the Blues.</p>
<p>United drew 1-1 with Brentford last time out, also on Saturday, with Mason Mount on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>Thursday's match will be refereed by Jarred Gillett, who has taken charge of 16 Premier League games so far this season, issuing two red cards and booking 76 players. He has awarded five penalties. </p>
<p>The last Chelsea game Gillett refereed was a 2-2 away draw with Brentford on March 2. His last United match was their 4-3 win away at Wolverhampton Wanderers on February 1.</p>
