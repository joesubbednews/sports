<p style="font-weight: bold;">Arsenal host Crystal Palace in Saturday lunchtime's match at the Emirates Stadium looking to bounce back from defeat last time out in the Premier League.</p>
<p>The Gunners, who sit fourth in the league after 20 games, fell to a 2-1 away defeat to Fulham on December 31.</p>
<p>They face a Palace side who picked up a win in their last match, a 3-1 victory against Brentford, and who sit 15th in the table.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Arsenal and Palace have played each other on 20 occasions. Arsenal won 11 of them, Palace three, and they drew six times.</p>
<p>On average, the Gunners scored 1.9 goals and the Eagles 1.2 in those matches.</p>

<p>Their last meeting was on August 21, when Arsenal won 1-0 away.</p>
<p>With 22 goals in 20 games so far this season, Palace are the league's third-lowest scorers with 1.1 goals per game. But they are conceding fewer than average too, letting in 29 goals at a rate of 1.4 per game.</p>
<p>Arsenal, meanwhile, are above average scorers, with 1.9 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.5. They have conceded 1.0 goal per game.</p>
<p>The Gunners are in mixed form in the Premier League, with two wins and a draw from their last six games.</p>
<p>With a win and two draws over that period, the Eagles's form is slightly worse – they have taken five points from 18, compared to the hosts' seven.</p>

<p>In David Raya, Arsenal can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept five clean sheets in his 15 appearances this season in the Premier League.</p>
<p>In the away team's net, Sam Johnstone also has five clean sheets in 16 games. He has conceded a goal every 80 minutes, only slightly more often than the 84 minutes between goals for Raya Martin.</p>
<p>Saturday's match will be refereed by Paul Tierney, who has taken charge of 12 Premier League games so far this season, issuing three red cards and booking 45 players. He has awarded three penalties. </p>
<p>The last Arsenal game Tierney refereed was a 2-2 home draw with Fulham on August 26. His last Palace match was their 2-2 draw away at Manchester City on December 16.</p>
