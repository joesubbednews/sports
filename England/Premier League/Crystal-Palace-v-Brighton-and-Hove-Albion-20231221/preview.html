<p style="font-weight: bold;">Brighton and Hove Albion are strong favourites to take all three points despite Crystal Palace's home advantage in Thursday's late match at Selhurst Park.</p>
<p>*Betting Company* are offering odds of 2.0 on Brighton sealing the win, with the visitors sitting ninth in the Premier League table.</p>
<p>Palace, who are 16th in the league and nine points behind Brighton, are priced at 3.35 to win. A draw is set at 3.4.</p>
<p>Palace are in terrible form in the Premier League, with no wins and two draws from their last six games.</p>
<p>With two wins and two draws over that period, Brighton's form is much better – they have taken eight points from 18, compared to the Eagles' two.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Palace and Brighton have played each other on 13 occasions. Palace won three of them, Brighton four, and they drew six times.</p>
<iframe src="1-match-odds.html" title="Crystal Palace v Brighton and Hove Albion match odds" height="120" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
<p>On average, the Eagles scored 1.1 goals and Brighton 1.2 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on March 15, when Brighton won 1-0 at home.</p>
<p>With 17 goals in 17 games so far this season, the hosts are scoring at below the league average rate with 1.0 goals per game. And they are conceding at an average rate, letting in 25 goals at a rate of 1.5 per game.</p>
<p>Albion, meanwhile, are above average scorers, with 1.9 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.5. They have conceded 1.8 goals per game.</p>
<p>In Sam Johnstone, Palace can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept five clean sheets in his 16 appearances this season in the Premier League.</p>

<p>the away side, meanwhile, are yet to keep a clean sheet this season.</p>
<p>Palace's last match was on Saturday, a 2-2 draw against Manchester City, with Jean-Philippe Mateta and Michael Olise getting the goals for the Eagles.</p>
<p>Brighton lost 2-0 against Arsenal last time out, on Sunday.</p>
<p>Thursday's match will be refereed by John Brooks, who has taken charge of 10 Premier League games so far this season, issuing four red cards and booking 46 players. He has awarded three penalties. </p>
<p>The last Palace game Brooks refereed was a 1-0 away win against Sheffield United on August 12. His last Brighton match was their 1-1 draw at home against Sheffield United on November 12.</p>
