<p style="font-weight: bold;">Everton welcome Aston Villa to Goodison Park on early Sunday looking to pick up points to end their three-game losing streak.</p>
<p>Everton's struggles have left them with nine points from their last six Premier League matches, while their opponents have earned 13 from a possible 18.</p>
<p>With 43 goals in 20 games so far this season, Villa are the league's joint-second-highest scorers with 2.1 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 27 goals at a rate of 1.4 per game.</p>
<p>Everton, meanwhile, are below average scorers, with 1.2 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.6. They have conceded 1.4 goals per game.</p>
<p>In Jordan Pickford, the Toffees can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept six clean sheets in his 20 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in the Premier League.</p>
<p>In the Villa's net, Emiliano Martínez has four clean sheets in 19 games.</p>
<p>The visitors are second in the table after 20 games, of which they have won 13 and drawn three, earning 42 points.</p>
