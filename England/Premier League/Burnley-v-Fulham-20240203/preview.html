<p style="font-weight: bold;">Burnley and Fulham both come into Saturday's kick-off at Turf Moor in poor form, having picked up only four points each in their last six games.</p>
<p>The two teams have each collected one win and one draw from their last six outings.</p>
<p>Burnley are 19th in the table after 22 games, of which they have won three and drawn three, earning 12 points.</p>
<p>Fulham are six places ahead of the Clarets in 13th, with seven wins and four draws putting them on 25 points.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Burnley and Fulham have played each other on eight occasions. Burnley won six of them, Fulham one, and they drew once.</p>
<iframe src="1-match-odds.html" title="Burnley v Fulham match odds" height="120" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
<p>On average, the Clarets scored 2.2 goals and the Cottagers 1.1 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on December 23, when Burnley won 2-0 away.</p>
<p>With Bernd Leno between the sticks, the Cottagers can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept six clean sheets in his 22 appearances this season, and only two other 'keepers – Everton's Jordan Pickford and Liverpool's Alisson Becker – have been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in the Premier League.</p>
<p>In the hosts' net, James Trafford has two clean sheets in 22 games. He has conceded a goal every 48 minutes, 30% more often than the 62 minutes between goals for Leno.</p>
<p>With 22 goals in 22 games so far this season, Burnley are the league's second-lowest scorers with 1.0 goals per game. And they are conceding more than average, letting in 45 goals at a rate of 2.0 per game.</p>

</div>
<p>The away team are also below average scorers, with 1.3 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.6. They have conceded 1.6 goals per game.</p>
<p>Burnley's last match was on Wednesday, a 3-1 loss against Manchester City, with Ameen Al Dakhil getting the goal for the Clarets.</p>
<p>Fulham drew 0-0 with Everton last time out, on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Saturday's match will be refereed by Darren Bond, who has taken charge of one Premier League game so far this season, issuing one red card and booking five players. He has awarded one penalty. </p>
<p>The last Fulham game Bond refereed was the 3-0 loss at home against Brentford on August 19. He is yet to oversee a match featuring Burnley this season.</p>
