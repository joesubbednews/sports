<p>In Dominic Solanke, Bournemouth have one of the league's most on-form strikers so far this season. He has notched 13 goals in 22 appearances, to sit third in the scoring charts.</p>
<p>His goal rate of one every 151 minutes is quicker than that of Raúl Jiménez, Fulham's top scorer with a goal every 250 minutes, and a total of five goals in 19 games.</p>
<p>The Cottagers are in disappointing form in the Premier League, with one win and two draws from their last six games.</p>
