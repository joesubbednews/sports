<p style="font-weight: bold;">Tottenham Hotspur are heavy favourites to keep all three points at home in Saturday's kick-off against Everton.</p>
<p>Spurs, who sit fifth in the Premier League with 17 games played, are priced at 1.6 to seal victory at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
<p>Sitting five places and seven points behind them in the table, Everton are 4.4 to win with *Betting Company*, while the draw is at 4.1.</p>
<p>In Jordan Pickford, Everton can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept six clean sheets in his 17 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in the Premier League.</p>
<p>In Spurs' net, Guglielmo Vicario has five clean sheets in 17 games.</p>

<p>The Toffees, meanwhile, are below average scorers, with 1.3 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.5. They have conceded 1.2 goals per game.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Spurs and Everton have played each other on 20 occasions. Spurs won 10 of them, Everton two, and they drew eight times.</p>
<p>On average, Spurs scored 2.0 goals and the Toffees 0.9 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on April 3, when they played out a 1-1 draw.</p>

<p>The home side are in mixed form in the Premier League, with two wins and a draw from their last six games.</p>
<p>With five wins and one loss over that period, the visitors' form is much better – they have taken 15 points from 18, compared to Spurs' seven.</p>
<p>Spurs' last match was on December 15, a 2-0 win against Nottingham Forest, with Dejan Kulusevski and Richarlison getting the goals for Spurs.</p>
