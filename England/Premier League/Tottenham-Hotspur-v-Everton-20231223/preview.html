<p>Everton beat Burnley 2-0 last time out, on Saturday, with Amadou Onana and Michael Keane on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>Saturday's match will be refereed by Stuart Attwell, who has taken charge of nine Premier League games so far this season, issuing one red card and booking 45 players. He has awarded two penalties. </p>
<p>The last Everton game Attwell refereed was the 1-0 win away at West Ham United on October 29. He is yet to oversee a match featuring Spurs this season.</p>
