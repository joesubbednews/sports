<p>The Hatters, meanwhile, are top of the standings with 54 points, having won 16 and drawn six.</p>
<p>With 56 goals in 27 games so far this season, Stockport are the league's second-highest scorers with 2.1 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 27 goals at a rate of 1.0 per game.</p>

<p>In Ben Hinchiffe, County can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 10 clean sheets in his 27 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in EFL League Two.</p>
<p>In Rovers' net, Louis Jones has four clean sheets in 18 games. He has conceded a goal every 71 minutes, 40% more often than the 97 minutes between goals for Hinchiffe.</p>
<p>The Rovers are in bad form in EFL League Two, with one win and a draw from their last six games.</p>
<p>With three wins and two draws over that period, the Hatters' form is much better – they have taken 11 points from 18, compared to the home team's four.</p>
<p>In the last three years, Doncaster and Stockport have played each other on three occasions. They won one each, and they drew once.</p>

<p>Stockport beat Walsall 3-1 last time out, also on January 13, with Akil Wright, Isaac Olaofe and Paddy Madden on the scoresheet.</p>
