<p>His goal rate of one every 146 minutes is quicker than that of Andy Cook, Bradford's top scorer with a goal every 206 minutes, and a total of 15 goals in 37 games.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Salford and Bradford have played each other on 10 occasions. Salford won five of them, Bradford three, and they drew twice.</p>
