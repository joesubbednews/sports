<p>Wimbledon also lost, 2-0 at home against Newport County.</p>

<p>In Crewe's net, Harvey Davies has seven clean sheets in 27 games. He has conceded a goal every 68 minutes, 30% more often than the 90 minutes between goals for Bass.</p>
<p>With 66 goals in 38 games so far this season, the Railwaymen are scoring more than average in the league with 1.7 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 54 goals at a rate of 1.4 per game.</p>

<p>With three wins and a draw over that period, Wimbledon's form is better – they have taken 10 points from 18, compared to the Railwaymen's seven.</p>
<p>Saturday's match will be refereed by Darren Drysdale, who has taken charge of 12 EFL League Two games so far this season, issuing one red card and booking 46 players. He has awarded five penalties. </p>
<p>The last Crewe game Drysdale refereed was a 1-0 away loss to Bradford City on August 26. His last Wimbledon match was their 1-1 draw at home against Wrexham on August 12.</p>
