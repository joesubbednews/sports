<p style="font-weight: bold;">AFC Wimbledon travel to Doncaster Rovers on Saturday in EFL League Two.</p>
<p>The visitors come into the game on the back of a defeat in their last match, having lost to Crawley Town 1-0 at home.</p>
<p>The Rovers, meanwhile, won their last match, 5-1 against Grimsby Town, with their goals scored by Niall Maher, Joe Ironside, Luke Molyneux, Matthew Craig and Kyle Hurst.</p>
<p>In Alex Bass, Wimbledon can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 11 clean sheets in his 33 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Mansfield Town's Christy Pym – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in EFL League Two.</p>
<p>In Doncaster's net, Louis Jones has four clean sheets in 19 games. He has conceded a goal every 61 minutes, 40% more often than the 83 minutes between goals for Bass.</p>

<p>In the last 10 years, Doncaster and Wimbledon have played each other on 14 occasions. Doncaster won four of them, Wimbledon five, and they drew five times.</p>
<p>On average, the Rovers scored 1.2 goals and the Dons 1.4 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on November 11, when Wimbledon won 2-0 at home.</p>
<p>Rovers are 20th in the table after 32 games, of which they have won 10 and drawn six, earning 36 points.</p>
<p>The Dons are 11 places ahead of the Rovers in ninth, with 12 wins and 11 draws putting them on 47 points.</p>
