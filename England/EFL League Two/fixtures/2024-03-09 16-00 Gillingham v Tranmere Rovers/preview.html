<p style="font-weight: bold;">Tranmere Rovers travel to Gillingham on Saturday in EFL League Two.</p>

<p>The Gills, meanwhile, lost their last match, 2-0 against Barrow.</p>
<p>With 34 goals in 36 games so far this season, Gillingham are the league's joint-second-lowest scorers with 0.9 goals per game. But they are conceding fewer than average too, letting in 41 goals at a rate of 1.1 per game.</p>
