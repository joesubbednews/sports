<p>In Jake Turner, the Gills can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 10 clean sheets in his 26 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in EFL League Two.</p>
<p>In the Green's net, Luke Daniels has three clean sheets in 15 games. He has conceded a goal every 54 minutes, 40% more often than the 75 minutes between goals for Turner.</p>
<p>With 23 goals in 26 games so far this season, the hosts are the league's lowest scorers with 0.9 goals per game. But they are conceding fewer than average too, letting in 31 goals at a rate of 1.2 per game.</p>
<p>The away side are also below average scorers, with 1.0 goal per game, compared to a league average of 1.5. They have conceded 1.8 goals per game.</p>
