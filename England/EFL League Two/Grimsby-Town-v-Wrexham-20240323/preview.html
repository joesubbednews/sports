<p style="font-weight: bold;">Wrexham travel to Blundell Park for Saturday's match against Grimsby Town looking to bounce back from defeat last time out in EFL League Two.</p>
<p>The Dragons, who sit third in the league after 38 games, fell to a 1-0 home defeat to Tranmere Rovers on March 16.</p>
<p>They face a Grimsby side who secured a draw in their last match, a 1-1 tie with Gillingham, and who sit 21st in the table.</p>
<p>With 67 goals in 38 games so far this season, Wrexham are scoring more than average in the league with 1.8 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 47 goals at a rate of 1.2 per game.</p>
