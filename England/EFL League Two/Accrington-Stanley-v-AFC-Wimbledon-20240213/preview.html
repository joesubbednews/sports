<p style="font-weight: bold;">Accrington Stanley host AFC Wimbledon on Tuesday at the Wham Stadium in EFL League Two.</p>
<p>In their last league match, on Saturday, Accrington lost to Milton Keynes Dons 2-1 away, with their goal scored by Jack Nolan.</p>
<p>Wimbledon won, 2-0 at home against Barrow, with Omar Bugiel and Ronan Curtis on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>In Alex Bass, Wimbledon can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 11 clean sheets in his 30 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Mansfield Town's Christy Pym – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in EFL League Two.</p>
<p>In Accrington's net, Jon McCracken has three clean sheets in 11 games. He has conceded a goal every 65 minutes, 30% more often than the 84 minutes between goals for Bass.</p>
