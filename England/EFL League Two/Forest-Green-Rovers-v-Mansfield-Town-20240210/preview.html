<p style="font-weight: bold;">Mid-season relegation candidates Forest Green Rovers face a challenge against high-flying Mansfield Town at the Bolt New Lawn on Saturday.</p>
<p>Forest Green Rovers are rooted to the bottom of the EFL League Two table, and have picked up four wins and eight draws in their 29 games to date.</p>
<p>The Stags, meanwhile, are second in the standings with 54 points, having won 14 and drawn 12, and are four points behind table-toppers Stockport County.</p>
<p>In Christy Pym, Mansfield can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 11 clean sheets in his 29 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in EFL League Two.</p>
<p>In Forest Green's net, Luke Daniels has three clean sheets in 18 games. He has conceded a goal every 54 minutes, more than twice as often as the 119 minutes between goals for Pym.</p>
