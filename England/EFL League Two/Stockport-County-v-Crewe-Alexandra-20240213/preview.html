<div class="story-inner">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Two of EFL League Two's top sides face each other at Edgeley Park in Tuesday's late kick-off, when table-topping Stockport County host third-placed Crewe Alexandra.</p>
<p>Stockport have picked up 18 wins and seven draws from 30 games so far this season, and sit seven points above the visitors going into the 7.45pm match.</p>
<p>The Railwaymen, meanwhile, have won 15 and drawn nine of 31, picking up 54 points.</p>
<p>With 65 goals in 30 games so far this season, Stockport are the league's highest scorers with 2.2 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 30 goals at a rate of 1.0 per game.</p>
<p>Crewe are also above average scorers, with 1.8 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.5. They have conceded 1.4 goals per game.</p>

<p>In Ben Hinchiffe, County can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 10 clean sheets in his 30 appearances this season, and only two other 'keepers – Mansfield Town's Christy Pym and AFC Wimbledon's Alex Bass – have been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in EFL League Two.</p>
<p>In the Railwaymen's net, Harvey Davies has six clean sheets in 23 games. He has conceded a goal every 67 minutes, 40% more often than the 96 minutes between goals for Hinchiffe.</p>
<p>The Hatters are in reasonable form in EFL League Two, with three wins and two draws from their last six games.</p>
<p>With four wins and a draw over that period, the away team's form is slightly better – they have taken 13 points from 18, compared to the hosts' 11.</p>
<p>In the last three years, Stockport and Crewe have played each other on three occasions. Stockport won two of them and they drew once.</p>

<p>Their last meeting was on October 24, when Stockport won 2-0 away.</p>
<p>Stockport's last match was on Saturday, a 3-1 win against Grimsby Town, with Antoni Sarcevic, Isaac Olaofe and Lewis Cass getting the goals for the Hatters.</p>
<p>Crewe beat Crawley Town 1-0 last time out, also on Saturday, with Rio Adebisi on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>Tuesday's match will be refereed by Neil Hair, who has taken charge of six EFL League Two games so far this season, issuing no red cards and booking 15 players. He has awarded six penalties. </p>
<p>He is yet to oversee a match featuring either Stockport or Crewe this season.</p>
