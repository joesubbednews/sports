<p style="font-weight: bold;">Bradford City face AFC Wimbledon at the University of Bradford Stadium on Saturday looking to secure a first win in eight EFL League Two games.</p>
<p>The Bantams have lost three and drawn four matches since they last earned three points – against Doncaster Rovers on December 22.</p>
<p>They face a Wimbledon side who have won three and drawn one over that time.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Bradford and Wimbledon have played each other on nine occasions. Bradford won four of them, Wimbledon two, and they drew three times.</p>
<p>On average, the Bantams scored 1.2 goals and the Dons 1.1 in those matches.</p>

<p>Their last meeting was on October 14, when Bradford won 1-0 away.</p>
<p>With 35 goals in 29 games so far this season, Bradford are scoring at below the league average rate with 1.2 goals per game. But they are conceding fewer than average too, letting in 39 goals at a rate of 1.3 per game.</p>
<p>Wimbledon, meanwhile, are above average scorers, with 1.6 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.5. They have conceded 1.2 goals per game.</p>
<p>In Alex Bass, the Dons can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept nine clean sheets in his 28 appearances this season in EFL League Two.</p>
<p>In City's net, Harry Lewis has eight clean sheets in 26 games. He has conceded a goal every 73 minutes, 10% more often than the 79 minutes between goals for Bass.</p>
