<p style="font-weight: bold;">Mid-season relegation candidates Sutton United face a challenge against high-flying Barrow at the VBS Community Stadium on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sutton United are rooted to the bottom of the EFL League Two table, and have picked up four wins and six draws in their 25 games to date.</p>
<p>The Bluebirds, meanwhile, are fourth in the standings with 48 points, having won 13 and drawn nine of their first 26 matches, and are three points behind table-toppers Stockport County.</p>
<p>With Paul Farman between the sticks, Barrow can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept nine clean sheets in his 24 appearances this season in EFL League Two.</p>
<p>In Sutton's net, Dean Anthony Bouzanis has two clean sheets in 17 games. He has conceded a goal every 49 minutes, more than twice as often as the 103 minutes between goals for Farman.</p>
<p>United are in disappointing form in EFL League Two, with one win and two draws from their last six games.</p>

<p>Saturday's match will be refereed by Paul Howard, who has taken charge of nine EFL League Two games so far this season, issuing one red card and booking 27 players. He has awarded one penalty. </p>
