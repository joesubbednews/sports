<p style="font-weight: bold;">Bradford City visit Doncaster Rovers at the Eco-Power Stadium on late Friday on the back of three consecutive wins in EFL League Two.</p>
<p>Bradford have picked up nine points from their last six games, and they face a Rovers side who lost their last match, and have collected seven points from the last possible 18.</p>
<p>With Harry Lewis between the sticks, Bradford can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept seven clean sheets in his 21 appearances this season in EFL League Two.</p>
<p>In Doncaster's net, Louis Jones has three clean sheets in 14 games. He has conceded a goal every 66 minutes, 10% more often than the 73 minutes between goals for Lewis.</p>
<p>Rovers are 19th in the table after 21 games, of which they have won seven and drawn three, earning 24 points.</p>

<p>City are five places ahead of the Rovers in 14th, with eight wins and five draws putting them on 29 points.</p>
<p>In the last five years, Doncaster and Bradford have played each other on four occasions. They won one each, and they drew twice.</p>
<p>On average, the Rovers scored 0.2 goals and the Bantams 0.2 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on February 25, when Bradford won 1-0 away.</p>
