<p style="font-weight: bold;">Bradford City are heavy favourites to keep all three points at home in Saturday's kick-off against Newport County.</p>
<p>The Bantams, who sit ninth in EFL League Two with 45 games played, are priced at 1.4 to seal victory at the University of Bradford Stadium.</p>
<p>Sitting eight places and 11 points behind them in the table, Newport are 7.0 to win with *Betting Company*, while the draw is at 4.6.</p>
<p>Bradford are in fantastic form in EFL League Two, with five wins and a draw from their last six games.</p>
<p>With no wins and six losses over that period, Newport's form is much worse – they have taken no points from 18, compared to City's 16.</p>
