<div class="story-inner">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Two of EFL League Two's meanest defences go head-to-head at the Cherry Red Records Stadium on Saturday, when Barrow visit AFC Wimbledon.</p>
<p>Only two sides – Mansfield Town and Stockport County – have conceded fewer goals than Barrow to date: the away side have let in just 30 goals in 30 games.</p>
<p>The Dons have conceded 34 goals in 29 games, giving them the fourth tightest back line so far this season.</p>
<p>Key to the Bluebirds' home form has been Paul Farman, who has allowed 0.96 goals past him per 90 minutes, compared to 1.1 for Alex Bass in the opposite net.</p>
<p>Barrow are third in the table after 30 games, of which they have won 14 and drawn 11, earning 53 points.</p>

<p>Wimbledon are six places behind the Bluebirds in ninth, with 11 wins and 10 draws putting them on 43 points.</p>
<p>In the last five years, Wimbledon and Barrow have played each other on four occasions. Barrow won two of them and they drew twice.</p>
<p>On average, the Dons scored 0.2 goals and the Bluebirds 0.8 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on October 21, when they played out a 0-0 draw.</p>
<p>In Ali Al-Hamadi, the Dons have one of the league's most on-form strikers so far this season. He has notched 13 goals in 23 appearances, to sit eighth in the scoring charts.</p>

<p>His goal rate of one every 152 minutes is slightly quicker than that of Ben Whitfield, the away side's top scorer with a goal every 126 minutes, and a total of seven goals in 20 games.</p>
<p>The hosts are in mixed form in EFL League Two, with two wins and two draws from their last six games.</p>
<p>And also with two wins and two draws over that period, Barrow's form is identical – they have both taken eight points from 18.</p>
<p>Wimbledon's last match was on February 3, a 0-0 draw against Bradford City.</p>
<p>Barrow beat Milton Keynes Dons 1-0 last time out, also on February 3, with Cole Stockton on the scoresheet.</p>
