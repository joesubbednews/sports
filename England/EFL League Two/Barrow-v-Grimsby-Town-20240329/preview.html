<p style="font-weight: bold;">Barrow face Grimsby Town on Friday seeking to protect their long unbeaten run in EFL League Two.</p>
<p>The Bluebirds are unbeaten in five, with three wins and two draws, ahead of the 3pm kick-off.</p>
<p>They face a Grimsby team who have won one and drawn three over the same number of games.</p>
<p>With Paul Farman between the sticks, Barrow can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 14 clean sheets in his 36 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – AFC Wimbledon's Alex Bass – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in EFL League Two.</p>
<p>In Grimsby's net, Harvey Cartwright has five clean sheets in 23 games. He has conceded a goal every 54 minutes, 60% more often than the 88 minutes between goals for Farman.</p>
