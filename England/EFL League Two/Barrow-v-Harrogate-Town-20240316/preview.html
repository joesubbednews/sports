<p style="font-weight: bold;">Barrow are heavy favourites to keep all three points at home in Saturday's kick-off against Harrogate Town.</p>
<p>The Bluebirds, who sit sixth in EFL League Two with 36 games played, are priced at 1.6 to seal victory at the SO Legal Stadium.</p>
<p>Sitting eight places and 10 points behind them in the table, Harrogate are 5.5 to win with *Betting Company*, while the draw is at 4.0.</p>
<p>Barrow are in mixed form in EFL League Two, with two wins and a draw from their last six games.</p>
<p>With no wins and three draws over that period, Harrogate's form is worse – they have taken three points from 18, compared to the Bluebirds' seven.</p>
