<p style="font-weight: bold;">Maidenhead United face Woking on Saturday seeking to protect their long unbeaten run in National League.</p>
<p>Maidenhead are unbeaten in seven, with five wins and two draws, ahead of the 3pm kick-off.</p>
<p>They face a Woking team who have won just two and lost five over the same number of games.</p>
<p>In Craig Alexander Ross, Maidenhead can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept seven clean sheets in his 24 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Halifax Town's Samuel William Johnson – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in National League.</p>
<p>In Woking's net, William Jääskeläinen has six clean sheets in 18 games.</p>
