<p style="font-weight: bold;">Barnet are heavy favourites to keep all three points at home in Saturday's kick-off against Boreham Wood.</p>
<p>The Bees, who sit third in National League with 23 games played, are priced at 1.7 to seal victory at the Hive Stadium.</p>
<p>Sitting 12 places and 16 points behind them in the table, Boreham Wood are 3.6 to win with *Betting Company*, while the draw is at 3.9.</p>
<p>With 44 goals in 23 games so far this season, Barnet are the league's third-highest scorers with 1.9 goals per game. But they are conceding more than average too, letting in 36 goals at a rate of 1.6 per game.</p>
<p>Boreham Wood, meanwhile, are below average scorers, with 1.3 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.5. They have conceded 1.4 goals per game.</p>

<p>In Nicke Kabamba, the Bees have one of the league's sharpest shooters so far this season. He has notched 13 goals in 23 appearances, to sit second in the scoring charts.</p>
<p>His goal rate of one every 150 minutes is much quicker than that of Tyrone Kallum Marsh, the Wood's top scorer with a goal every 315 minutes, and a total of six goals in 23 games.</p>
<p>The hosts are in bad form in National League, with one win and a draw from their last six games.</p>
<p>With two wins and two draws over that period, the away team's form is better – they have taken eight points from 18, compared to Barnet's four.</p>
<p>In the last three years, Barnet and Boreham Wood have played each other on 10 occasions. Barnet won three of them, Boreham Wood four, and they drew three times.</p>
