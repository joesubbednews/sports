<p style="font-weight: bold;">Southend United are strong favourites to take all three points despite Kidderminster Harriers's home advantage in Saturday's match at the Aggborough Stadium.</p>
<p>*Betting Company* are offering odds of 1.9 on Southend sealing the win, with the visitors sitting eighth in National League table.</p>
<p>Kidderminster Harriers, who are 23rd in the league and 16 points behind the Shrimpers, are priced at 3.42 to win. A draw is set at 3.32.</p>
<p>In Christian Dibble, Kidderminster Harriers can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept seven clean sheets in his 24 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Halifax Town's Samuel William Johnson – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in National League.</p>

<p>In Southend's net, Collin Andeng Ndi has three clean sheets in nine games. He has conceded a goal every 68 minutes, 10% more often than the 77 minutes between goals for Dibble.</p>
<p>With 17 goals in 24 games so far this season, Kiddy are the league's lowest scorers with 0.7 goals per game. But they are conceding fewer than average too, letting in 30 goals at a rate of 1.2 per game.</p>
<p>United, meanwhile, are above average scorers, with 1.7 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.5. They have conceded 1.1 goals per game.</p>
<p>The hosts are in disappointing form in National League, with one win and two draws from their last six games.</p>
