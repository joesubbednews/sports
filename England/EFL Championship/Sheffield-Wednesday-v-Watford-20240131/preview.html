<p>Wednesday are in disappointing form in EFL Championship, with two wins and four losses from their last six games.</p>
<p>With two wins and three draws over that period, the away side's form is better – they have taken nine points from 18, compared to Wednesday's six.</p>
<p>Wednesday's match will be refereed by Tom Nield, who has taken charge of six EFL Championship games so far this season, issuing no red cards and booking 24 players. He has awarded one penalty. </p>
<p>He is yet to oversee a match featuring either Wednesday or Watford this season.</p>
