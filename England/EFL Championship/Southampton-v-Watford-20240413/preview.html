<p style="font-weight: bold;">Southampton are heavy favourites to keep all three points at home in Saturday's kick-off against Watford.</p>
<p>The Saints, who sit fourth in EFL Championship with 40 games played, are priced at 1.3 to seal victory at St. Mary's.</p>
<p>Sitting 10 places and 26 points behind them in the table, Watford are 6.2 to win with *Betting Company*, while the draw is at 4.8.</p>
<p>With 78 goals in 40 games so far this season, Southampton are the league's third-highest scorers with 2.0 goals per game. And they are conceding at an average rate, letting in 52 goals at a rate of 1.3 per game.</p>
<p>Watford are also above average scorers, with 1.4 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.3. They have conceded 1.3 goals per game.</p>
<p>In Adam Armstrong, the Saints have one of the league's most on-form strikers so far this season. He has notched 20 goals in 40 appearances, to sit second in the scoring charts.</p>

<p>In the last 10 years, Southampton and Watford have played each other on 17 occasions. Southampton won seven of them, Watford two, and they drew eight times.</p>
