<p style="font-weight: bold;">West Bromwich Albion travel to Norwich City on Saturday in EFL Championship.</p>
<p>The visitors come into the game on the back of a win in their last match, having beaten Blackburn Rovers 4-1 at home, with two goals from Brandon Thomas-Asante, one from Dominic Hyam and one from Tom Fellows.</p>
<p>The Canaries also won their last match, 2-1 against Hull City, with their goals scored by Christian Fassnacht and Jon Rowe.</p>
<p>In Alex Palmer, West Bromwich can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 12 clean sheets in his 27 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in EFL Championship.</p>
<p>In Norwich's net, Angus Gunn has five clean sheets in 21 games. He has conceded a goal every 80 minutes, 30% more often than the 106 minutes between goals for Palmer.</p>
