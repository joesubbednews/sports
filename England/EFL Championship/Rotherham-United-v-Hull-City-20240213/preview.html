<p style="font-weight: bold;">Hull City are strong favourites to take all three points despite Rotherham United's home advantage in Tuesday's late match at the AESSEAL New York Stadium.</p>
<p>*Betting Company* are offering odds of 1.74 on Hull sealing the win, with the visitors sitting eighth in EFL Championship table.</p>
<p>Rotherham, who are 24th in the league and 26 points behind the Tigers, are priced at 4.62 to win. A draw is set at 3.72.</p>
<p>Rotherham are in bad form in EFL Championship, with no wins and three draws from their last six games.</p>
<p>With three wins and three losses over that period, Hull's form is much better – they have taken nine points from 18, compared to United's three.</p>
