<p style="font-weight: bold;">Norwich City face a challenge to maintain their high-scoring form at home against a tight Bristol City defence on Saturday.</p>
<p>With 76 goals in 43 games, Norwich are the joint-fourth-highest scorers in EFL Championship ahead of the 3pm kick-off at Carrow Road.</p>
<p>They face a Robins side who have scored 50 in 43 matches, but conceded only 46 goals, putting them fourth among the league's tightest defences – only Leicester City, Leeds United and West Bromwich Albion have conceded fewer goals.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Norwich and Bristol City have played each other on 12 occasions. Norwich won eight of them, Bristol City one, and they drew three times.</p>
<p>On average, the Canaries scored 1.6 goals and the Robins 0.8 in those matches.</p>

<p>Their last meeting was on December 3, when Norwich won 2-1 away.</p>
<p>Norwich are sixth in the table after 43 games, of which they have won 21 and drawn eight, earning 71 points.</p>
<p>Bristol City are six places behind Norwich City in 12th, with 16 wins and 10 draws putting them on 58 points.</p>
<p>In Joshua Sargent, the Canaries have one of the league's sharpest shooters so far this season. He has notched 15 goals in 23 appearances, to sit fifth in the scoring charts.</p>
<p>His goal rate of one every 107 minutes is much quicker than that of Tommy Conway, the Robins' top scorer with a goal every 233 minutes, and a total of nine goals in 36 games.</p>

<p>With three wins and two draws over that period, the away team's form is slightly worse – they have taken 11 points from 18, compared to Norwich's 13.</p>
<p>Norwich's last match was on April 13, a 1-0 win against Preston North End, with Gabriel Sara getting the goal for the Canaries.</p>
<p>Bristol City drew 1-1 with Huddersfield Town last time out, also on April 13, with Nahki Wells on the scoresheet.</p>
