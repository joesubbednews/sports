<p style="font-weight: bold;">Leicester City are strong favourites to take all three points despite Watford's home advantage in Saturday's match at Vicarage Road.</p>
<p>*Betting Company* are offering odds of 1.91 on Leicester sealing the win, with the visitors sitting first in EFL Championship table.</p>
<p>Watford, who are 11th in the league and 31 points behind the Foxes, are priced at 3.43 to win. A draw is set at 3.33.</p>
<p>With 64 goals in 30 games so far this season, Leicester are the league's highest scorers with 2.1 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 23 goals at a rate of 0.8 per game.</p>
<p>Watford are also above average scorers, with 1.5 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.4. They have conceded 1.3 goals per game.</p>
<iframe src="1-match-odds.html" title="Watford v Leicester City match odds" height="120" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
<p>In the last 10 years, Watford and Leicester have played each other on 14 occasions. Watford won three of them, Leicester 10, and they drew once.</p>
<p>On average, the Hornets scored 0.9 goals and the Foxes 2.2 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on November 25, when Leicester won 2-0 at home.</p>
<p>With Mads Hermansen between the sticks, City can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 10 clean sheets in his 29 appearances this season, and only two other 'keepers – West Bromwich Albion's Alex Palmer and Leeds United's Illan Meslier – have been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in EFL Championship.</p>
<p>In the Hornets's net, Daniel Bachmann has six clean sheets in 16 games. He has conceded a goal every 76 minutes, 90% more often than the 145 minutes between goals for Hermansen.</p>

<p>The hosts are in mixed form in EFL Championship, with one win and four draws from their last six games.</p>
<p>With four wins and a draw over that period, the Foxes' form is much better – they have taken 13 points from 18, compared to Watford's seven.</p>
<p>Watford's last match was on February 3, a 1-0 loss against Cardiff City.</p>
<p>Leicester beat Stoke City 5-0 last time out, also on February 3, with Jamie Vardy (two), Patson Daka (two) and Kasey McAteer on the scoresheet.</p>
