<p style="font-weight: bold;">Leeds United are strong favourites to take all three points despite Coventry City's home advantage in Saturday's match at the Coventry Building Society Arena.</p>
<p>*Betting Company* are offering odds of 1.97 on Leeds sealing the win, with the visitors sitting second in EFL Championship table.</p>
<p>Coventry, who are seventh in the league and 26 points behind Leeds, are priced at 3.25 to win. A draw is set at 3.75.</p>
<p>With 75 goals in 40 games so far this season, Leeds are scoring more than average in the league with 1.9 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 31 goals at a rate of 0.8 per game.</p>

<p>With Illan Meslier between the sticks, United can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 17 clean sheets in his 38 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in EFL Championship.</p>
<p>In City's net, Bradley Collins has seven clean sheets in 21 games. He has conceded a goal every 99 minutes, 30% more often than the 130 minutes between goals for Meslier.</p>
<p>The Sky Blues are in mixed form in EFL Championship, with three wins and three losses from their last six games.</p>
<p>With four wins and two draws over that period, the away side's form is better – they have taken 14 points from 18, compared to the hosts' nine.</p>
