<p style="font-weight: bold;">Sunderland are on a poor run ahead of hosting Bristol City at the Stadium of Light on Saturday, with just four points collected from their last six games.</p>
<p>The Black Cats have picked up one win and one draw in their last six EFL Championship games, and face a Robins side whose last six games have brought three wins and three losses.</p>
<p>In Jack Clarke, Sunderland have one of the league's most on-form strikers so far this season. He has notched 15 goals in 34 appearances, to sit fifth in the scoring charts.</p>
<p>His goal rate of one every 198 minutes is quicker than that of Tommy Conway, City's top scorer with a goal every 276 minutes, and a total of seven goals in 33 games.</p>
<p>With 44 goals in 40 games so far this season, the Robins are scoring at below the league average rate with 1.1 goals per game. But they are conceding fewer than average too, letting in 45 goals at a rate of 1.1 per game.</p>
