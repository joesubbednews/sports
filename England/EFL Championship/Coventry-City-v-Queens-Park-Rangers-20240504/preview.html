<p>Coventry's last match was on Tuesday, a 2-1 loss against Ipswich Town, with Haji Wright getting the goal for the Sky Blues.</p>
<p>QPR beat Leeds United 4-0 last time out, on April 26, with Ilias Chair, Lucas Andersen, Lyndon Dykes and Sam Field on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>Saturday's match will be refereed by Joshua Smith, who has taken charge of 25 EFL Championship games so far this season, issuing four red cards and booking 99 players. He has awarded four penalties. </p>
<p>The last QPR game Smith refereed was the 2-1 win at home against Birmingham City on March 29. He is yet to oversee a match featuring Coventry this season.</p>
