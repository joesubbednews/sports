<p>With 50 goals in 31 games so far this season, Norwich are scoring more than average in the league with 1.6 goals per game. But they are conceding more than average too, letting in 47 goals at a rate of 1.5 per game.</p>

<p>With a win and three draws over that period, the Hornets's form is worse – they have taken six points from 18, compared to the Canaries' 11.</p>
