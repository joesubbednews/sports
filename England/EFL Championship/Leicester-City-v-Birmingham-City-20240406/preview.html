<p style="font-weight: bold;">Leicester City are heavy favourites to keep all three points at home in Saturday's kick-off against Birmingham City.</p>
<p>The Foxes, who sit third in EFL Championship with 39 games played, are priced at 1.3 to seal victory at the King Power Stadium.</p>
<p>Sitting 17 places and 43 points behind them in the table, Birmingham are 7.3 to win with *Betting Company*, while the draw is at 5.2.</p>
<p>With 77 goals in 39 games so far this season, Leicester are the league's second-highest scorers with 2.0 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 35 goals at a rate of 0.9 per game.</p>
<p>Birmingham, meanwhile, are below average scorers, with 1.1 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.4. They have conceded 1.5 goals per game.</p>
<iframe src="1-match-odds.html" title="Leicester City v Birmingham City match odds" height="120" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
<p>Leicester City are in mixed form in EFL Championship, with two wins and a draw from their last six games.</p>
<p>With a win and a draw over that period, Birmingham City's form is worse – they have taken four points from 18, compared to the Foxes' seven.</p>
<p>With Mads Hermansen between the sticks, the hosts can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 12 clean sheets in his 38 appearances this season in EFL Championship.</p>
<p>In the Blues' net, John Ruddy has eight clean sheets in 38 games. He has conceded a goal every 68 minutes, 70% more often than the 118 minutes between goals for Hermansen.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, Leicester and Birmingham have played each other twice. Leicester won both of them.</p>
