<p style="font-weight: bold;">Struggling Queens Park Rangers face Huddersfield Town at Loftus Road on Sunday looking to build on a win in their last league outing.</p>
<p>After securing all three points with a 2-0 victory over Millwall on January 20, QPR sit 22nd in EFL Championship.</p>
<p>They travel to play a Huddersfield side 21st in the standings, who were held in their last match, 1-1 against Blackburn Rovers.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, QPR and Huddersfield have played each other on 13 occasions. QPR won two of them, Huddersfield seven, and they drew four times.</p>
<iframe src="1-match-odds.html" title="Queens Park Rangers v Huddersfield Town match odds" height="120" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
<p>On average, QPR scored 0.8 goals and the Terriers 1.4 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on October 21, when Huddersfield won 2-1 at home.</p>
