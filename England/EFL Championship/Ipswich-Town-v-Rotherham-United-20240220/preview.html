<p style="font-weight: bold;">Relegation candidates Rotherham United face a challenge away against high-flying Ipswich Town at Portman Road on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Rotherham United are rooted to the bottom of the EFL Championship table, and have picked up just three wins and 10 draws in their 32 games to date.</p>
<p>The Blues, meanwhile, are fourth in the standings with 66 points, having won 19 and drawn nine, and are 12 points behind table-toppers Leicester City.</p>
<p>Ipswich are in reasonable form in EFL Championship, with three wins and two draws from their last six games.</p>
<p>With no wins and a draw over that period, Rotherham's form is much worse – they have taken one point from 18, compared to Town's 11.</p>
<p>With 26 goals in 32 games so far this season, United are the league's joint-second-lowest scorers with 0.8 goals per game. And they are conceding more than average, letting in 60 goals at a rate of 1.9 per game.</p>

<p>In the last 10 years, Ipswich and Rotherham have played each other on 14 occasions. Ipswich won four of them, Rotherham eight, and they drew twice.</p>
<p>On average, the Blues scored 1.1 goals and the Millers 1.3 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on November 7, when they played out a 2-2 draw.</p>
<p>The hosts' Leif Davis is the league's most creative player, racking up 12 assists in 29 appearances so far this season.</p>
