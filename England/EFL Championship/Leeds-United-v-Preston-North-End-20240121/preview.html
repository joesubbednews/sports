<p style="font-weight: bold;">Leeds United are heavy favourites to keep all three points at home in Sunday lunchtime's kick-off against Preston North End.</p>
<p>Leeds, who sit fourth in EFL Championship with 27 games played, are priced at 1.2 to seal victory at Elland Road.</p>
<p>Sitting eight places and 13 points behind them in the table, Preston are 8.8 to win with *Betting Company*, while the draw is at 5.2.</p>
<p>With 48 goals in 27 games so far this season, Leeds are scoring more than average in the league with 1.8 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 25 goals at a rate of 0.9 per game.</p>
<p>Preston, meanwhile, are below average scorers, with 1.2 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.4. They have conceded 1.6 goals per game.</p>
<p>With Illan Meslier between the sticks, United can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept nine clean sheets in his 25 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – West Bromwich Albion's Alex Palmer – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in EFL Championship.</p>
<iframe src="1-match-odds.html" title="Leeds United v Preston North End match odds" height="120" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
<p>In North End's net, Freddie Woodman has four clean sheets in 26 games. He has conceded a goal every 63 minutes, 80% more often than the 111 minutes between goals for Meslier.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Leeds and Preston have played each other on 12 occasions. Leeds won five of them, Preston three, and they drew four times.</p>
<p>On average, Leeds scored 1.5 goals and the Lilywhites 0.9 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on December 26, when Preston won 2-1 at home.</p>
<p>The hosts are in mixed form in EFL Championship, with three wins and a draw from their last six games.</p>

</div>
<p>With two wins and four losses over that period, the Lilywhites' form is worse – they have taken six points from 18, compared to Leeds's 10.</p>
<p>Leeds's last match was on January 13, a 3-0 win against Cardiff City, with Daniel James, Georginio Rutter and Patrick Bamford getting the goals for Leeds.</p>
<p>Preston beat Bristol City 2-0 last time out, also on January 13, with Will Keane on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>Sunday's match will be refereed by David Webb, who has taken charge of 17 EFL Championship games so far this season, issuing one red card and booking 68 players. He has awarded two penalties. </p>
<p>The last Leeds game Webb refereed was a 1-0 home win against Queens Park Rangers on October 4. His last Preston match was their 4-2 loss away at Ipswich Town on October 7.</p>
