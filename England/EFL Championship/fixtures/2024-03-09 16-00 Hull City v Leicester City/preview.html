<p>With Mads Hermansen between the sticks, the visitors can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 12 clean sheets in his 35 appearances this season, and only two other 'keepers – West Bromwich Albion's Alex Palmer and Leeds United's Illan Meslier – have been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in the EFL Championship.</p>
<p>In the Tigers' net, Ryan Allsop has eight clean sheets in 27 games. He has conceded a goal every 87 minutes, 40% more often than the 126 minutes between goals for Hermansen.</p>
<p>Hull's last match was on Tuesday, a 1-1 draw against Birmingham City, with Ozan Tufan getting the goal for the Tigers.</p>
<p>Leicester beat Sunderland 1-0 last time out, also on Tuesday, with Jamie Vardy on the scoresheet.</p>
