<p style="font-weight: bold;">Middlesbrough Women travel to the Sincil Bank Stadium for Sunday's early match against York City LFC looking to bounce back from defeat last time out in Women's National League Division One North. </p>
<p> Middlesbrough, who sit third in the league after 13 games, fell to a 1-0 away defeat to Stockport County Women on January 21. </p>
<p> They face a York City side who also lost their last match, a 1-0 defeat to Stockport County Women, and who sit 10th in the table.</p>
<p>With 20 goals in 13 games so far this season, Middlesbrough are scoring at below the league average rate with 1.5 goals per game. But they are conceding fewer than average too, letting in eight goals at a rate of 0.6 per game.  </p>
<p> York City are also below average scorers, with 1.5 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.6. They have conceded 1.7 goals per game.</p>

<p>The hosts are in disappointing form in Women's National League Division One North, with one win and two draws from their last six games. </p>
<p> With four wins and a draw over that period, the away team's form is much better – they have taken 13 points from 18, compared to York City's five.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, York City and Middlesbrough have played each other twice. They won one each. </p>
<p> Their last meeting was on February 5, when York City won 4-1 at home.</p>
