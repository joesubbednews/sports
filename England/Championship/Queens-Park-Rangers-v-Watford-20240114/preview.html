<p style="font-weight: bold;">Watford are strong favourites to take all three points despite Queens Park Rangers's home advantage in Sunday lunchtime's match at Loftus Road.</p>
<p>*Betting Company* are offering odds of 1.51 on Watford sealing the win, with the visitors sitting 10th in the Championship table.</p>
<p>QPR, who are 23rd in the league and 15 points behind the Hornets, are priced at 4.59 to win. A draw is set at 4.36.</p>
<p>QPR are in terrible form in the Championship, with no wins and two draws from their last six games.</p>
<p>With two wins and two draws over that period, Watford's form is much better – they have taken eight points from 18, compared to Rangers's two.</p>
