<p style="font-weight: bold;">Leeds United are strong favourites to take all three points despite Blackburn Rovers' home advantage in Saturday lunchtime's match at Ewood Park.</p>
<p>*Betting Company* are offering odds of 1.85 on Leeds sealing the win, with the visitors sitting third in the Championship table.</p>
<p>Blackburn, who are seventh in the league and 10 points behind Leeds, are priced at 3.9 to win. A draw is set at 3.8.</p>
<p>With 34 goals in 19 games so far this season, Leeds are the league's joint-second-highest scorers with 1.8 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 20 goals at a rate of 1.1 per game.</p>

<p>In Samuel Szmodics, Rovers have the league's sharpest shooter so far this season. He has notched 14 goals in 19 appearances.</p>
<p>His goal rate of one every 119 minutes is quicker than that of Crysencio Summerville, United's top scorer with a goal every 155 minutes, and a total of eight goals in 16 games.</p>
<p>The hosts are in mixed form in the Championship, with three wins and three losses from their last six games.</p>
<p>With five wins and a draw over that period, the away team's form is much better – they have taken 16 points from 18, compared to Blackburn's nine.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Blackburn and Leeds have played each other on 12 occasions. Blackburn won five of them and Leeds seven.</p>
