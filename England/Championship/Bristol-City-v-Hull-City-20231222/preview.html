<p>With Max O’Leary between the sticks, the home side can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept six clean sheets in his 22 appearances this season in the Championship.</p>
<p>In the visitors' net, Ryan Allsop has five clean sheets in 16 games. He has conceded a goal every 76 minutes, 20% more often than the 90 minutes between goals for O’Leary.</p>
<p>Bristol City are in mixed form in the Championship, with two wins and a draw from their last six games.</p>
<p>With three wins and a draw over that period, Hull's form is better – they have taken 10 points from 18, compared to Bristol City's seven.</p>
