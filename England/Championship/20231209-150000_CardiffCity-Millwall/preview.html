<p style="font-weight: bold;">Cardiff City host Millwall on Saturday at the Cardiff City Stadium in the Championship.</p>
<p>In their last league match, on December 2, Cardiff lost to Southampton 2-0 away.</p>
<p>Millwall drew, 1-1 at home against Sunderland, with Kevin Nisbet scoring their goals.</p>
<p>In Jak Alnwick, Cardiff can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept six clean sheets in his 15 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – West Bromwich Albion's Alex Palmer – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in the Championship.</p>
<p>In Millwall's net, Bartosz Bialkowski has four clean sheets in 14 games. He has conceded a goal every 66 minutes, 60% more often than the 104 minutes between goals for Alnwick.</p>
