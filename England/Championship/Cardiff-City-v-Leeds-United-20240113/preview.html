<p style="font-weight: bold;">Leeds United are strong favourites to take all three points despite Cardiff City's home advantage in Saturday's match at the Cardiff City Stadium.</p>
<p>*Betting Company* are offering odds of 1.65 on Leeds sealing the win, with the visitors sitting fourth in the Championship table.</p>
<p>Cardiff, who are ninth in the league and 11 points behind Leeds, are priced at 5 to win. A draw is set at 3.75.</p>
<p>With 45 goals in 26 games so far this season, Leeds are scoring more than average in the league with 1.7 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 25 goals at a rate of 1.0 per game.</p>
<p>Cardiff, meanwhile, are below average scorers, with 1.3 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.4. They have also conceded 1.3 goals per game.</p>

<p>United's Georginio Rutter is the league's most creative player, racking up nine assists in 25 appearances so far this season.</p>
<p>For City, Joe Ralls has set up the most goals, having laid on six assists in 22 games.</p>
