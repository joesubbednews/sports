<p style="font-weight: bold;">Coventry City are heavy favourites to keep all three points at home in Friday's late kick-off against Birmingham City.</p>

<p>Despite sitting two places and one point ahead of them in the table, Birmingham are 5.5 to win with *Betting Company*, while the draw is at 3.8.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Coventry and Birmingham have played each other on eight occasions. Coventry won two of them and they drew six times.</p>

<p>On average, the Sky Blues scored 1.1 goals and the Blues 0.6 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on April 29, when Coventry won 2-0 at home.</p>
