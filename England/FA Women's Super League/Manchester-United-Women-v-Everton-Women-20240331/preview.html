<div class="story-inner">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Everton Women come to the Leigh Sports Village Stadium to play Manchester United Women on Sunday lunchtime in poor form, having collected just four points from their last six games. </p>
<p> The visitors have won one and drawn one of their last six fixtures, while the Red Devils have three wins and a draw.</p>
<p>With 14 goals in 17 games so far this season, Everton are the league's lowest scorers with 0.8 goals per game. And they are conceding more than average, letting in 29 goals at a rate of 1.7 per game.  </p>
<p> Manchester United, meanwhile, are above average scorers, with 2.1 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.6. They have conceded 1.3 goals per game.</p>
<p>In Mary Earps, the Red Devils can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept six clean sheets in her 17 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Manchester City Women's Khiara Keating – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in the FA Women's Super League. </p>
<p> In the Toffees's net, Courtney Brosnan has four clean sheets in 15 games. She has conceded a goal every 56 minutes, 30% more often than the 73 minutes between goals for Earps.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Manchester United and Everton have played each other on 15 occasions. Manchester United won 12 of them, Everton one, and they drew twice. </p>

<p> The hosts are five places ahead of Everton in fifth, with eight wins and four draws putting them on 28 points.</p>
