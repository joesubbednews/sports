<p style="font-weight: bold;">Sunday's early match at Robins High Performance Centre sees the league's two bottom sides face each other, as rock-bottom Bristol City Women host West Ham United Women. </p>

<p> That is the same number of points as the Hammers have collected, having also won one and drawn two.</p>
<p>Bristol City are in terrible form in FA Women's Super League, with no wins and two draws from their last six games. </p>

<p> But with no wins and a draw over that period, West Ham United's form is even worse – they have taken one point from 18, compared to the Robins' two.</p>
<p>In the last five years, Bristol City and West Ham United have played each other on four occasions. Bristol City won one of them, West Ham United two, and they drew once. </p>
<p> On average, the Robins scored 1.2 goals and the Hammers 2.2 in those matches. </p>
<p> Their last meeting was on November 5, when Bristol City won 3-2 away.</p>
