<p style="font-weight: bold;">Everton Women are heavy favourites to keep all three points at home in Sunday lunchtime's kick-off against Leicester City WFC. </p>
<p> The Toffees, who sit eighth in FA Women's Super League with 11 games played, are priced at 1.6 to seal victory at Walton Hall Park. </p>
<p> Sitting two places and one point behind them in the table, Leicester City WFC are 4.2 to win with *Betting Company*, while the draw is at 3.8.</p>
<p>Everton are in mixed form in FA Women's Super League, with two wins and a draw from their last six games. </p>
<p> With no wins and three draws over that period, Leicester City WFC's form is worse – they have taken three points from 18, compared to the Toffees's seven.</p>
<iframe src="1-match-odds.html" title="Everton Women v Leicester City WFC match odds" height="120" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
<p>In the last 10 years, Everton and Leicester City WFC have played each other on seven occasions. Everton won five of them, Leicester City WFC one, and they drew once. </p>
<p> On average, the Toffees scored 1.7 goals and Leicester City WFC 0.6 in those matches. </p>
<p> Their last meeting was on October 8, when Leicester City WFC won 1-0 at home.</p>
<p>In Courtney Brosnan, the home team can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept two clean sheets in her nine appearances this season, and only two other 'keepers – Manchester United Women's Mary Earps and Manchester City Women's Khiara Keating – have been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in FA Women's Super League. </p>
<p> In the visitors' net, Janina Leitzig has one clean sheet in 11 games. She has conceded a goal every 50 minutes, only slightly more often than the 51 minutes between goals for Brosnan.</p>
