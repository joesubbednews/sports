<p style="font-weight: bold;">Liverpool Women travel to Aston Villa Women on early Sunday in the FA Women's Super League. </p>
<p> The visitors come into the game on the back of a win in their last match, having beaten Brighton and Hove Albion Women 1-0 away, with a goal from Ceri Holland. </p>
<p> The Villa also won their last match, 2-1 against Tottenham Hotspur Women, with their goals scored by Adriana Leon and Jordan Nobbs.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Aston Villa and Liverpool have played each other on six occasions. They won two each, and they drew twice. </p>
<p> On average, the Villa scored 1.3 goals and Liverpool 1.8 in those matches. </p>
<p> Their last meeting was on October 8, when Liverpool won 2-0 at home.</p>
<p>With Rachael Laws between the sticks, Liverpool can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept three clean sheets in her 10 appearances this season, and only two other 'keepers – Manchester City Women's Khiara Keating and Manchester United Women's Mary Earps – have been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in the FA Women's Super League. </p>

<p> Liverpool are three places ahead of Aston Villa in fifth, with six wins and four draws putting them on 22 points.</p>
