<p style="font-weight: bold;">Tottenham Hotspur Women travel to Manchester United Women on Sunday lunchtime in the FA Women's Super League. </p>
<p> The visitors come into the game on the back of a win in their last match, having beaten Bristol City Women 1-0 away, with a goal from Bethany England. </p>
<p> The Red Devils also won their last match, 4-1 against Everton Women, with their goals scored by Ella Toone, Leah Galton and Millie Turner.</p>
<p>With 39 goals in 18 games so far this season, Manchester United are scoring more than average in the league with 2.2 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 23 goals at a rate of 1.3 per game.  </p>
<p> Tottenham Hotspur, meanwhile, are below average scorers, with 1.4 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.7. They have conceded 1.7 goals per game.</p>
<p>In Mary Earps, the Red Devils can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept six clean sheets in her 18 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Manchester City Women's Khiara Keating – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in the FA Women's Super League. </p>
<p> In Spurs's net, Rebecca Leigh Spencer has two clean sheets in 12 games. She has conceded a goal every 57 minutes, 30% more often than the 74 minutes between goals for Earps.</p>
