<div class="story-inner">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Manchester United Women are heavy favourites to keep all three points at home in Sunday lunchtime's kick-off against Tottenham Hotspur Women. </p>
<p> The Red Devils, who sit fourth in the FA Women's Super League with 18 games played, are priced at 1.3 to seal victory at the Leigh Sports Village Stadium. </p>
<p> Sitting two places and six points behind them in the table, Tottenham Hotspur are 6.8 to win with *Betting Company*, while the draw is at 4.8.</p>
<p>With 39 goals in 18 games so far this season, Manchester United are scoring more than average in the league with 2.2 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 23 goals at a rate of 1.3 per game.  </p>
<p> Tottenham Hotspur, meanwhile, are below average scorers, with 1.4 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.7. They have conceded 1.7 goals per game.</p>
<p>In Mary Earps, the Red Devils can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept six clean sheets in her 18 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Manchester City Women's Khiara Keating – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in the FA Women's Super League. </p>
<iframe src="1-match-odds.html" title="Manchester United Women v Tottenham Hotspur Women match odds" height="120" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
<p> In Spurs's net, Rebecca Leigh Spencer has two clean sheets in 12 games. She has conceded a goal every 57 minutes, 30% more often than the 74 minutes between goals for Earps.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur have played each other on 11 occasions. Manchester United won 10 of them and they drew once. </p>
<p> On average, the Red Devils scored 3.0 goals and Spurs 0.5 in those matches. </p>
<p> Their last meeting was on December 10, when Manchester United won 4-0 away.</p>
<p>The home team are in mixed form in the FA Women's Super League, with three wins and a draw from their last six games. </p>

</div>
<p> With two wins and a draw over that period, the visitors' form is worse – they have taken seven points from 18, compared to Manchester United's 10.</p>
<p>Manchester United's last match was on March 31, a 4-1 win against Everton Women, with Ella Toone (two), Leah Galton and Millie Turner getting the goals for the Red Devils. </p>
<p> Tottenham Hotspur beat Bristol City Women 1-0 last time out, on March 24, with Bethany England on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>Sunday's match will be refereed by Rebecca Welch, who has taken charge of five FA Women's Super League games so far this season, issuing one red card and booking 28 players. She has awarded two penalties.  </p>
<p> The last Manchester United game Welch refereed was a 2-1 away win against Aston Villa Women on October 1. She is yet to oversee a match featuring Tottenham Hotspur this season.</p>
