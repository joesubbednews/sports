<p style="font-weight: bold;">Peterborough United are heavy favourites to keep all three points at home in Tuesday's late kick-off against Port Vale.</p>

<p>With Nicholas Bilokapic between the sticks, the home team can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 10 clean sheets in his 27 appearances this season in EFL League One.</p>
<p>In the visitors' net, Connor Ripley has seven clean sheets in 29 games. He has conceded a goal every 65 minutes, 20% more often than the 76 minutes between goals for Bilokapic.</p>
<p>Peterborough's last match was on Saturday, a 5-2 loss against Wycombe Wanderers, with David Ibukun Ajiboye and Ricky Jade-Jones getting the goals for the Posh.</p>
<p>Vale drew 2-2 with Stevenage last time out, also on Saturday, with Funso-King Ojo and Terence Owen Vancooten (own goal) on the scoresheet.</p>
