<p style="font-weight: bold;">Derby County are strong favourites to take all three points despite Wycombe Wanderers' home advantage in Wednesday's late match at Adams Park.</p>
<p>*Betting Company* are offering odds of 1.8 on Derby sealing the win, with the visitors sitting second in EFL League One table.</p>
<p>Wycombe, who are 15th in the league and 31 points behind the Rams, are priced at 4.25 to win. A draw is set at 3.4.</p>
<p>With 72 goals in 42 games so far this season, Derby are scoring more than average in the league with 1.7 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 37 goals at a rate of 0.9 per game.</p>
<p>Wycombe, meanwhile, are average scorers, with 1.3 goals per game. They have also conceded 1.3 goals per game.</p>
<p>With Joe Wildsmith between the sticks, County can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 16 clean sheets in his 36 appearances this season, and only two other 'keepers – Portsmouth's Will Norris and Lincoln City's Lukas Jensen – have been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in EFL League One.</p>
<iframe src="1-match-odds.html" title="Wycombe Wanderers v Derby County match odds" height="120" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
<p>In Wanderers' net, Maksymilian Stryjek has seven clean sheets in 33 games. He has conceded a goal every 86 minutes, 40% more often than the 118 minutes between goals for Wildsmith.</p>
<p>The Chairboys are in mixed form in EFL League One, with three wins and a draw from their last six games.</p>
<p>With four wins and a draw over that period, the Rams' form is better – they have taken 13 points from 18, compared to the home side's 10.</p>
<p>In the last five years, Wycombe and Derby have played each other on five occasions. Wycombe won one of them, Derby two, and they drew twice.</p>
<p>On average, the Chairboys scored 1.4 goals and the Rams 1.6 in those matches.</p>

<p>Their last meeting was on December 16, when they played out a 1-1 draw.</p>
<p>Wycombe's last match was on April 1, a 0-0 draw against Blackpool.</p>
<p>Derby drew 2-2 with Portsmouth last time out, on April 2, with Joe Ward on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>Wednesday's match will be refereed by Alex Chilowicz, who has taken charge of six EFL League One games so far this season, issuing no red cards and booking 19 players. He has not awarded any penalties. </p>
<p>He is yet to oversee a match featuring either Wycombe or Derby this season.</p>
