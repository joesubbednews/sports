<p style="font-weight: bold;">Struggling Fleetwood Town face Derby County at the Highbury Stadium on Saturday looking to build on a win in their last league outing.</p>
<p>After securing all three points with a 1-3 victory over Shrewsbury Town on Monday, the Cod Army sit bottom of EFL League One.</p>
<p>They travel to play a Derby side fourth in the standings, who lost in their last match, 3-2 against Peterborough United.</p>

<p>With 44 goals in 24 games so far this season, Derby are scoring more than average in the league with 1.8 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 23 goals at a rate of 1.0 per game.</p>
<p>Fleetwood, meanwhile, are below average scorers, with 0.9 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.3. They have conceded 1.8 goals per game.</p>
<p>Town are in terrible form in EFL League One, with no wins and two draws from their last six games.</p>

<p>With four wins and a draw over that period, County's form is much better – they have taken 13 points from 18, compared to the Cod Army's two.</p>
<p>With Joe Wildsmith between the sticks, the Rams can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 10 clean sheets in his 24 appearances this season, and only two other 'keepers – Portsmouth's Will Norris and Bolton Wanderers' Nathan Baxter – have been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in EFL League One.</p>
<p>In the home side's net, Jay Lynch has three clean sheets in 23 games. He has conceded a goal every 53 minutes, more than twice as often as the 118 minutes between goals for Wildsmith.</p>
