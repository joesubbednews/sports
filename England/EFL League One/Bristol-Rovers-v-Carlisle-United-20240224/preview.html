<p style="font-weight: bold;">Bristol Rovers are heavy favourites to keep all three points at home in Saturday's kick-off against Carlisle United.</p>
<p>The Gas, who sit 13th in EFL League One with 33 games played, are priced at 1.6 to seal victory at the Memorial Stadium.</p>
<p>Sitting 11 places and 23 points behind them in the table, Carlisle are 4.6 to win with *Betting Company*, while the draw is at 3.8.</p>
<p>Rovers are in mixed form in EFL League One, with three wins and three losses from their last six games.</p>
<p>With no wins and six losses over that period, Carlisle's form is much worse – they have taken no points from 18, compared to the Gas's nine.</p>
