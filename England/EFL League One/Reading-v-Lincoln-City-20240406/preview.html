<p style="font-weight: bold;">Lincoln City visit Reading at the Select Car Leasing Stadium on Saturday on the back of five consecutive wins in EFL League One.</p>
<p>Lincoln have picked up 16 points from their last six games, and they face a Royals side who lost their last match, and have collected nine points from the last possible 18.</p>
<p>With Lukas Jensen between the sticks, Lincoln can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 18 clean sheets in his 40 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in EFL League One.</p>
<p>In Reading's net, David Button has eight clean sheets in 36 games. He has conceded a goal every 70 minutes, 70% more often than the 120 minutes between goals for Jensen.</p>
