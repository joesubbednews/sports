<p>The home side are in disappointing form in EFL League One, with one win and two draws from their last six games.</p>
<p>With three wins and three losses over that period, the Latics' form is better – they have taken nine points from 18, compared to Shrewsbury's five.</p>
<p>Saturday's match will be refereed by Lee Swabey, who has taken charge of eight EFL League One games so far this season, issuing two red cards and booking 45 players. He has awarded two penalties. </p>
<p>The last Shrewsbury game Swabey refereed was a 3-0 home loss to Portsmouth on December 16. He is yet to oversee a match featuring Wigan this season.</p>
