<p>In the last five years, Carlisle and Cheltenham have played each other on five occasions. Carlisle won one of them, Cheltenham three, and they drew once.</p>
<p>On average, Carlisle scored 0.8 goals and the Robins 1.2 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on April 27 2021, when they played out a 1-1 draw.</p>
