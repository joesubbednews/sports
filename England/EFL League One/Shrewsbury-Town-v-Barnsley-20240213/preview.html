<p style="font-weight: bold;">Barnsley travel to Shrewsbury Town on late Tuesday in EFL League One.</p>

<p>The Shrews, meanwhile, drew their last match, 1-1 against Derby County, with their goal scored by Aaron Pierre.</p>
<p>With 22 goals in 31 games so far this season, Shrewsbury are the league's joint-second-lowest scorers with 0.7 goals per game. And they are conceding more than average, letting in 42 goals at a rate of 1.4 per game.</p>

<p>In the last 10 years, Shrewsbury and Barnsley have played each other on seven occasions. Shrewsbury won two of them and Barnsley five.</p>
<p>On average, the Shrews scored 1.0 goal and the Tykes 1.9 in those matches.</p>

<p>The last Barnsley game Parsons refereed was the 4-0 win away at Cambridge United on October 3. He is yet to oversee a match featuring Shrewsbury this season.</p>
