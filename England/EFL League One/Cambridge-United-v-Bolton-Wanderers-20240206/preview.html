<p style="font-weight: bold;">Bolton Wanderers travel to Cambridge United on late Tuesday in EFL League One.</p>
<p>The visitors come into the game on the back of a draw in their last match, having tied with Barnsley 1-1 at home, with a goal from Zachary Ashworth.</p>
<p>Cambridge, meanwhile, won their last match, 2-1 against Shrewsbury Town, with their goals scored by Lyle Taylor.</p>
<p>With 51 goals in 28 games so far this season, Bolton are scoring more than average in the league with 1.8 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 27 goals at a rate of 1.0 per game.</p>
<p>Cambridge, meanwhile, are below average scorers, with 0.9 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.3. They have conceded 1.2 goals per game.</p>

<iframe src="1-match-odds.html" title="Cambridge United v Bolton Wanderers match odds" height="120" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
<p>United are 11 places behind the visitors in 14th, with nine wins and eight draws putting them on 35 points.</p>
<p>With Nathan Baxter between the sticks, Bolton can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 12 clean sheets in his 28 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Portsmouth's Will Norris – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in EFL League One.</p>
<p>In the home side's net, Jack Stevens has nine clean sheets in 23 games. He has conceded a goal every 80 minutes, 30% more often than the 101 minutes between goals for Baxter.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Cambridge and Bolton have played each other on six occasions. Cambridge won one of them, Bolton two, and they drew three times.</p>
<p>On average, Cambridge scored 0.7 goals and Bolton 1.0 in those matches.</p>

<p>Their last meeting was on April 10, when they played out a 1-1 draw.</p>
<p>Cambridge are in mixed form in EFL League One, with two wins and two draws from their last six games.</p>
<p>With four wins and a draw over that period, Bolton's form is better – they have taken 13 points from 18, compared to Cambridge's eight.</p>
<p>Tuesday's match will be refereed by David Rock, who has taken charge of nine EFL League One games so far this season, issuing three red cards and booking 36 players. He has awarded two penalties. </p>
<p>The last Cambridge game Rock refereed was a 3-0 home loss to Lincoln City on November 28. His last Bolton match was their 3-0 win away at Cheltenham Town on August 12.</p>
