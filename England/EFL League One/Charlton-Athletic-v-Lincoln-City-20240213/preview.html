<p>In the last 10 years, Charlton and Lincoln have played each other on seven occasions. Charlton won two of them, Lincoln four, and they drew once.</p>
<p>On average, the Addicks scored 1.1 goals and the Imps 1.6 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on October 24, when Lincoln won 3-1 at home.</p>
