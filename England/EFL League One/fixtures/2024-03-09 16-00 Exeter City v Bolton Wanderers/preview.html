<p>City are 15 places behind the away team in 17th, with 11 wins and seven draws putting them on 40 points.</p>
<p>With Nathan Baxter between the sticks, Bolton can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 12 clean sheets in his 28 appearances this season in EFL League One.</p>
<p>In the hosts' net, Viljami Sinisalo has 10 clean sheets in 35 games. He has conceded a goal every 72 minutes, 40% more often than the 101 minutes between goals for Baxter.</p>

<p>On average, Exeter scored 0.6 goals and Bolton 2.4 in those matches.</p>

<p>Their last meeting was on November 25, when Bolton won 7-0 at home.</p>
<p>Exeter are in mixed form in EFL League One, with two wins and a draw from their last six games.</p>
<p>With two wins and two draws over that period, Bolton's form is slightly better â€“ they have taken eight points from 18, compared to Exeter's seven.</p>
<p>Saturday's match will be refereed by Daniel Middleton, who has taken charge of seven EFL League One games so far this season, issuing three red cards and booking 25 players. He has awarded two penalties. </p>
<p>The last Exeter game Middleton refereed was a 3-0 away loss to Oxford United on September 23. He is yet to oversee a match featuring Bolton this season.</p>
