<p>The hosts are in mixed form in EFL League One, with three wins and a draw from their last six games.</p>
<p>With two wins and a draw over that period, the away team's form is worse â€“ they have taken seven points from 18, compared to Reading's 10.</p>
<p>Saturday's match will be refereed by Carl Brook, who has taken charge of 11 EFL League One games so far this season, issuing one red card and booking 54 players. He has awarded four penalties. </p>
<p>The last Reading game Brook refereed was a 1-1 home draw with Oxford United on December 12. He is yet to oversee a match featuring Wycombe this season.</p>
