<p style="font-weight: bold;">Northampton Town are heavy favourites to keep all three points at home in Saturday's kick-off against Shrewsbury Town.</p>
<p>The Cobblers, who sit 10th in EFL League One with 27 games played, are priced at 1.6 to seal victory at the Sixfields Stadium.</p>
<p>Sitting 11 places and 10 points behind them in the table, Shrewsbury are 4.4 to win with *Betting Company*, while the draw is at 3.2.</p>
<p>Northampton are in good form in EFL League One, with four wins and a draw from their last six games.</p>
<p>With a win and five losses over that period, Shrewsbury's form is much worse – they have taken three points from 18, compared to Northampton Town's 13.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Northampton and Shrewsbury have played each other on seven occasions. Northampton won three of them, Shrewsbury two, and they drew twice.</p>
