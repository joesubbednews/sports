<p style="font-weight: bold;">Derby County are heavy favourites to keep all three points at home in Saturday's kick-off against Shrewsbury Town.</p>
<p>The Rams, who sit second in EFL League One with 30 games played, are priced at 1.3 to seal victory at Pride Park Stadium.</p>
<p>Sitting 15 places and 26 points behind them in the table, Shrewsbury are 7.2 to win with *Betting Company*, while the draw is at 4.3.</p>
<p>With 21 goals in 30 games so far this season, Shrewsbury are the league's joint-third-lowest scorers with 0.7 goals per game. And they are conceding more than average, letting in 41 goals at a rate of 1.4 per game.</p>
