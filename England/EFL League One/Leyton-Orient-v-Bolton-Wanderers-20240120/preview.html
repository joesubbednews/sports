<p style="font-weight: bold;">Bolton Wanderers visit Leyton Orient at Brisbane Road on Saturday on the back of four consecutive wins in EFL League One.</p>
<p>Bolton have picked up 12 points from their last six games, and they face an Orient side who have also won their last two matches, and collected 13 points from the last possible 18.</p>
<p>With 45 goals in 24 games so far this season, Bolton are scoring more than average in the league with 1.9 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 24 goals at a rate of 1.0 per game.</p>
<p>Orient, meanwhile, are below average scorers, with 1.1 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.3. They have conceded 1.2 goals per game.</p>

<p>With Nathan Baxter between the sticks, Wanderers can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 11 clean sheets in his 24 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Portsmouth's Will Norris – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in EFL League One.</p>
<p>In the hosts' net, Samuel Howes has one clean sheet in three games. He has conceded a goal every 45 minutes, more than twice as often as the 98 minutes between goals for Baxter.</p>
<p>The away side are fourth in the table after 24 games, of which they have won 16 and drawn three, earning 51 points.</p>

<p>Orient are seven places behind Bolton in 11th, with nine wins and eight draws putting them on 35 points.</p>

<p>Bolton beat Burton Albion 1-0 last time out, on January 1, with Jasper Moon on the scoresheet.</p>
