<p style="font-weight: bold;">Struggling Port Vale face Northampton Town away at the Sixfields Stadium on Monday looking to build on a win in their last league outing.</p>
<p>After securing all three points with a 2-0 victory over Bristol Rovers on Friday, the Valiants sit 21st in EFL League One.</p>
<p>They travel to play a Northampton side 12th in the standings, who lost in their last match, 1-0 against Reading.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Northampton and Vale have played each other on nine occasions. Northampton won three of them, Vale four, and they drew twice.</p>
<p>On average, the Cobblers scored 0.9 goals and the Valiants 1.1 in those matches.</p>
