<p>On average, the Gas scored 2.2 goals and Cambridge 1.0 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on August 19, when Cambridge won 2-0 at home.</p>

<p>His goal rate of one every 164 minutes is slightly quicker than that of Gassan Ahadme Yahyai, Cambridge's top scorer with a goal every 171 minutes, and a total of 10 goals in 25 games.</p>
<p>United are 18th in the table after 42 games, of which they have won 12 and drawn 10, earning 46 points.</p>
