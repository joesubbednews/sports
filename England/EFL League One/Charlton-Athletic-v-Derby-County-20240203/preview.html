<p>With 52 goals in 29 games so far this season, Derby are the league's joint-second-highest scorers with 1.8 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 28 goals at a rate of 1.0 per game.</p>
<p>Charlton are also above average scorers, with 1.5 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.3. They have conceded 1.6 goals per game.</p>
<p>In Alfie May, Athletic have the league's most on-form striker so far this season. He has notched 16 goals in 26 appearances.</p>

<p>His goal rate of one every 145 minutes is slightly quicker than that of James Collins, County's top scorer with a goal every 152 minutes, and a total of 13 goals in 29 games.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Charlton and Derby have played each other on 10 occasions. Charlton won three of them, Derby six, and they drew once.</p>
<p>On average, the Addicks scored 0.9 goals and the Rams 1.4 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on February 18, when Derby won 2-0 at home.</p>
