<p style="font-weight: bold;">Derby County are strong favourites to take all three points despite Charlton Athletic's home advantage in Saturday's match at the Valley.</p>
<p>*Betting Company* are offering odds of 2.0 on Derby sealing the win, with the visitors sitting fourth in EFL League One table.</p>
<p>Charlton, who are 18th in the league and 25 points behind the Rams, are priced at 3.4 to win. A draw is set at 3.45.</p>
<p>With 52 goals in 29 games so far this season, Derby are the league's joint-second-highest scorers with 1.8 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 28 goals at a rate of 1.0 per game.</p>
