<div class="story-inner">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Two of EFL League One's top sides face each other at the Weston Homes Stadium in Saturday's kick-off, when fourth-placed Peterborough United host table-topping Portsmouth.</p>
<p>Peterborough have picked up 21 wins and eight draws from 37 games so far this season, and sit nine points below the visitors going into the 3pm match.</p>
<p>Pompey, meanwhile, have won 23 and drawn 11 of 38, picking up 80 points.</p>
<p>With 74 goals in 37 games so far this season, Peterborough are the league's highest scorers with 2.0 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 45 goals at a rate of 1.2 per game.</p>
<p>Portsmouth are also above average scorers, with 1.6 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.3. They have conceded 0.8 goals per game.</p>
<p>With Will Norris between the sticks, Pompey can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 17 clean sheets in his 38 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in EFL League One.</p>

<p>Portsmouth beat Burton Albion 2-1 last time out, on Tuesday, with Kusini Boja Yengi on the scoresheet.</p>
