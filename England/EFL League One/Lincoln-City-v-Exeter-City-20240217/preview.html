<p>Their last meeting was on October 28, when they played out a 1-1 draw.</p>
<p>With Lukas Jensen between the sticks, Lincoln can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept 11 clean sheets in his 32 appearances this season, and only two other 'keepers – Portsmouth's Will Norris and Bolton Wanderers' Nathan Baxter – have been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in EFL League One.</p>
<p>In Exeter's net, Viljami Sinisalo has 10 clean sheets in 32 games. He has conceded a goal every 72 minutes, 40% more often than the 99 minutes between goals for Jensen.</p>
<p>With 25 goals in 33 games so far this season, Exeter City are the league's third-lowest scorers with 0.8 goals per game. And they are conceding more than average, letting in 46 goals at a rate of 1.4 per game.</p>
<p>Lincoln City are also below average scorers, with 1.1 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.3. They have conceded 1.0 goal per game.</p>
