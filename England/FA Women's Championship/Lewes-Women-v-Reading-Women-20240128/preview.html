<div class="story-inner">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Sunday's early match at the Dripping Pan sees two relegation candidates play each other, as 11th-ranked Lewes Women host 10th-placed Reading Women. </p>
<p> Lewes have picked up eight points from their first eight FA Women's Championship games, with two wins and two draws. </p>
<p> That is three points less than the Royals have collected, having won two and drawn five.</p>
<p>With Emily Orman between the sticks, Reading can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept four clean sheets in her 11 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Sunderland Women's Claudia Moan – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in the FA Women's Championship. </p>
<p> In Lewes's net, Sophie Whitehouse has one clean sheet in 10 games. She has conceded a goal every 69 minutes, only slightly more often than the 71 minutes between goals for Orman.</p>
<p>The home team are in mixed form in the FA Women's Championship, with two wins and a draw from their last six games. </p>

</div>
</div>
<p> With a win and two draws over that period, the Royals's form is slightly worse – they have taken five points from 18, compared to Lewes's seven.</p>
<p>With eight goals in 12 games so far this season, Lewes are the league's lowest scorers with 0.7 goals per game. And they are conceding more than average, letting in 19 goals at a rate of 1.6 per game.  </p>
<p> The visitors are also below average scorers, with 0.9 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.4. They have conceded 1.4 goals per game.</p>
<p>Lewes's last match was on January 21, a 1-1 draw against Durham Women, with Grace Riglar getting the goal for Lewes. </p>
<p> Reading drew 1-1 with Crystal Palace Women last time out, on December 17, with Lauren Wade on the scoresheet.</p>
