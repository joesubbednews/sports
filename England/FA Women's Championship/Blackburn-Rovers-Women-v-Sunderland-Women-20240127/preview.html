<p style="font-weight: bold;">Blackburn Rovers Women are on a poor run ahead of hosting Sunderland Women at Lancashire FA County Ground on Saturday, with just three points collected from their last six games. </p>
<p> Blackburn Rovers have picked up just one win in their last six FA Women's Championship games, and face a Sunderland side whose last six games have brought three wins and one draw.</p>
<p>In Claudia Moan, Sunderland can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept six clean sheets in her 13 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in the FA Women's Championship. </p>
<p> In Blackburn Rovers' net, Alexandra Brooks has four clean sheets in 11 games. She has conceded a goal every 66 minutes, more than twice as often as the 167 minutes between goals for Moan.</p>
<p>The away side are second in the table after 13 games, of which they have won seven and drawn four, earning 25 points. </p>
<p> The hosts are five places behind Sunderland in seventh, with five wins and six losses putting them on 15 points.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, Blackburn Rovers and Sunderland have played each other on eight occasions. They won four each. </p>
