<div class="story-inner">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Sunday's early match at the Dripping Pan sees the league's two bottom sides face each other, as Lewes Women host rock-bottom Watford Women. </p>
<p> Lewes have picked up 13 points from their first 13 FA Women's Championship games, with three wins and four draws. </p>
<p> That is one point more than Watford have collected, having won three and drawn three.</p>
<p>In Carly Johns, Watford have one of the league's most on-form strikers so far this season. She has notched six goals in 16 appearances, to sit fourth in the scoring charts. </p>
<p> Her goal rate of one every 210 minutes is quicker than that of Hollie Olding, Lewes's top scorer with a goal every 373 minutes, and a total of four goals in 17 games.</p>
<p>With 17 goals in 17 games so far this season, the home team are the league's third-lowest scorers with 1.0 goals per game. And they are conceding more than average, letting in 29 goals at a rate of 1.7 per game.  </p>
<p> The visitors are also below average scorers, with 1.1 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.4. They have conceded 1.9 goals per game.</p>

<p>Lewes are in disappointing form in the FA Women's Championship, with one win and three draws from their last six games. </p>

<p>In the last three years, Lewes and Watford have played each other on three occasions. Lewes won two of them and Watford one. </p>
<p> Their last meeting was on October 15, when Lewes won 2-1 away.</p>
<p>Lewes's last match was on Monday, a 2-1 loss against Blackburn Rovers Women, with Olding getting the goal for Lewes. </p>
<p> Watford lost 1-0 against Sheffield United Women last time out, on Wednesday.</p>
