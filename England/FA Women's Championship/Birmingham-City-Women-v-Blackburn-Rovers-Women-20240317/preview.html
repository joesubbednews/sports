<p style="font-weight: bold;">Birmingham City Women host Blackburn Rovers Women on Sunday at St Andrew's in the FA Women's Championship. </p>
<p> In their last league match, on February 18, Birmingham City lost to Southampton Women 2-1 at home, with their goal scored by Ivana Fuso. </p>
<p> Blackburn Rovers won, 2-1 at home against Lewes Women on Monday, with Hannah Coan and Lucy Shepherd on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>With 15 goals in 16 games so far this season, Blackburn Rovers are the league's joint-second-lowest scorers with 0.9 goals per game. And they are conceding more than average, letting in 25 goals at a rate of 1.6 per game.  </p>
<p> Birmingham City, meanwhile, are above average scorers, with 1.7 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.4. They have conceded 0.9 goals per game.</p>
<p>With Lucy Thomas between the sticks, the Blues can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept five clean sheets in her 15 appearances this season, and only two other 'keepers – Sunderland Women's Claudia Moan and Reading Women's Emily Orman – have been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in the FA Women's Championship. </p>
<p> In the away team's net, Alexandra Brooks also has five clean sheets in 16 games. She has conceded a goal every 63 minutes, 80% more often than the 113 minutes between goals for Lucy Thomas.</p>
