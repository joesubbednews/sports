<div class="story-inner">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Sunday's early match between Crystal Palace Women and Birmingham City Women promises to be one for the neutrals, as two of the FA Women's Championship's most free-scoring sides go head-to-head. </p>
<p> Ahead of the game at the VBS Community Stadium, Crystal Palace and the Blues sit top and third in the goal-scoring charts, with 43 and 25 goals respectively. </p>
<p> Midfielder Elise Hughes leads the way for the home side, having bagged 14 goals in their 15 games to date. </p>
<p> And Charlotte Devlin, Ivana Fuso and Libby Smith have been the main men in the opponents' penalty box for Birmingham City, with three goals each.</p>
<p>Crystal Palace are second in the table after 15 games, of which they have won nine and drawn three, earning 30 points. </p>
<p> Birmingham City are three places behind the home side in fifth, with eight wins and two draws putting them on 26 points.</p>
<p>With Lucy Thomas between the sticks, the Blues can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept five clean sheets in her 15 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Sunderland Women's Claudia Moan – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in the FA Women's Championship. </p>

<p> In Crystal Palace's net, Demi Lambourne has three clean sheets in eight games. She has conceded a goal every 87 minutes, 30% more often than the 113 minutes between goals for Lucy Thomas.</p>
<p>Crystal Palace are in mixed form in the FA Women's Championship, with three wins and a draw from their last six games. </p>
<p> With four wins and two losses over that period, the visitors' form is slightly better – they have taken 12 points from 18, compared to the hosts' 10.</p>
<p>In the last three years, Crystal Palace and Birmingham City have played each other on three occasions. Crystal Palace won one of them and Birmingham City the other. </p>
<p> Their last meeting was on September 3, when Crystal Palace won 2-1 away.</p>
<p>Crystal Palace's last match was on February 18, a 4-0 win against Blackburn Rovers Women, with Annabel Blanchard, Chloe Arthur, Isibeal Atkinson and Shanade Hopcroft getting the goals for Crystal Palace. </p>
<p> Birmingham City lost 2-1 against Southampton Women last time out, also on February 18, with Fuso on the scoresheet.</p>
