<p style="font-weight: bold;">Watford Women make the journey to the Lancashire FA County Ground to play Blackburn Rovers Women on early Saturday looking to pick up points to end their five-game losing streak. </p>
<p> Watford's struggles have left them with just three points from their last six FA Women's Championship matches, while their opponents have earned 12 from a possible 18.</p>
<p>Watford are bottom of the table after 20 games, of which they have won three and drawn three, earning 12 points. </p>
<p> Blackburn Rovers are six places ahead of the away team in sixth, with nine wins and three draws putting them on 30 points.</p>
<p>With Alexandra Brooks between the sticks, the hosts can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept seven clean sheets in her 20 appearances this season in the FA Women's Championship. </p>
<p> In Watford's net, Safia Middleton-Patel has two clean sheets in four games.</p>
