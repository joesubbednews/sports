Struggling Lewes Women face Blackburn Rovers Women away at Lancashire FA County Ground on Sunday looking to build on a win in their last league outing. 
 After securing all three points with a 2-1 victory over London City Lionesses on November 19, Lewes sit 11th in the FA Women's Championship. 
 They travel to play a Blackburn Rovers side sixth in the standings, who also won their last match, 1-0 against Sunderland Women, on November 12.
