<p>With Alexandra Brooks between the sticks, the hosts can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept six clean sheets in her 19 appearances this season in the FA Women's Championship. </p>
<p> In the away side's net, Emily Orman also has six clean sheets in 17 games. She has conceded a goal every 51 minutes, 30% more often than the 68 minutes between goals for Brooks.</p>
<p>With 17 goals in 19 games so far this season, Reading are the league's lowest scorers with 0.9 goals per game. And they are conceding more than average, letting in 37 goals at a rate of 1.9 per game.  </p>
<p> Blackburn Rovers are also below average scorers, with 1.1 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.4. They have conceded 1.4 goals per game.</p>
