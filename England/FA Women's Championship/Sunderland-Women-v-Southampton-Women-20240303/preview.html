<p style="font-weight: bold;">Two of the FA Women's Championship's top sides face each other at the Eppleton Colliery Football Ground in Sunday's early kick-off, when table-topping Sunderland Women host third-placed Southampton Women. </p>
<p> Sunderland have picked up nine wins and four draws from 16 games so far this season, and sit one point above the visitors going into the 2pm match. </p>
<p> The Saints, meanwhile, have won 10, picking up 30 points.</p>
<p>With 28 goals in 16 games so far this season, Southampton are the league's second-highest scorers with 1.8 goals per game. And they are conceding fewer than average, letting in 18 goals at a rate of 1.1 per game.  </p>
<p> Sunderland, meanwhile, are average scorers, with 1.4 goals per game. They have conceded 0.8 goals per game.</p>
<p>In Claudia Moan, the hosts can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept seven clean sheets in her 16 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in the FA Women's Championship. </p>
