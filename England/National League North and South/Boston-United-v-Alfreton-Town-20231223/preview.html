<p style="font-weight: bold;">Alfreton Town travel to Boston United on Saturday in National League North and South.</p>
<p>The visitors come into the game on the back of a win in their last match, having beaten Blyth Spartans 3-0 at home, with goals from Jordan Thewlis, Jake Day and Lewis Salmon.</p>
<p>The Pilgrims, meanwhile, drew their last match, 0-0 against Chester.</p>

<p>Alfreton are five places ahead of United in 18th, with nine wins and five draws putting them on 32 points.</p>
<p>With 22 goals in 22 games so far this season, the Pilgrims are the league's joint--17rd-lowest scorers with 1.0 goals per game. But they are conceding fewer than average too, letting in 23 goals at a rate of 1.0 per game.</p>

<p>With Cameron Gregory between the sticks, the hosts can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept nine clean sheets in his 22 appearances this season, and only two other 'keepers – Tamworth's Jasbir Singh and Chester's Wyll Stanway – have been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in National League North and South.</p>
<p>In the Reds' net, George Willis has six clean sheets in 19 games. He has conceded a goal every 90 minutes, only slightly more often than the 94 minutes between goals for Gregory.</p>
<p>In the last five years, Boston and Alfreton have played each other on nine occasions. Boston won two of them, Alfreton four, and they drew three times.</p>
<p>On average, the Pilgrims scored 1.0 goal and the Reds 1.6 in those matches.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on September 9, when Alfreton won 4-0 at home.</p>
<p>Boston are in mixed form in National League North and South, with two wins and two draws from their last six games.</p>
<p>And also with two wins and two draws over that period, the away team's form is identical – they have both taken eight points from 18.</p>
