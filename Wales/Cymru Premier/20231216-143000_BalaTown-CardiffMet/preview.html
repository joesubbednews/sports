<p style="font-weight: bold;">Cardiff Met travel to Bala Town on early Saturday in the Cymru Premier.</p>
<p>The visitors come into the game on the back of a win in their last match, having beaten Aberystwyth Town 4-2 at home, with two goals from Eliot Evans, one from Harry Owen and one from Christopher Jack Craven.</p>
<p>The Lakesiders also won their last match, 2-0 against Penybont, with their goals scored by Aeron Edwards and Arnaldo Paulo Fernandes Mendes.</p>
<p>With Kelland Absalom between the sticks, Bala can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept eight clean sheets in his 18 appearances this season, and no 'keeper has prevented the opposition scoring more often in the Cymru Premier.</p>
<p>In Cardiff's net, Alex Lang has five clean sheets in 17 games. He has conceded a goal every 64 minutes, 80% more often than the 116 minutes between goals for Absalom.</p>
