<p style="font-weight: bold;">Racing Santander face a challenge to maintain their high-scoring form at home against a tight Real Oviedo defence on Sunday.</p>
<p>With 29 goals in 18 games, Racing are the joint-second-highest scorers in the Segunda División ahead of the 3.15pm kick-off at Campos de Sport de El Sardinero.</p>
<p>They face a Real Oviedo side who have scored 17 in 18 matches, but conceded only 11 goals, putting them second among the league's tightest defences – only Leganés have conceded fewer goals.</p>

<p>His goal rate of one every 135 minutes is much quicker than that of Borja Bastón, Oviedo's top scorer with a goal every 279 minutes, and a total of five goals in 18 games.</p>
