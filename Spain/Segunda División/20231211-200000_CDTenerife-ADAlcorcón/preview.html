<p style="font-weight: bold;">CD Tenerife and AD Alcorcón both come into Monday's late kick-off at the Estadio Heliodoro Rodríguez Lopéz in poor form, having picked up only four points each in their last six games.</p>
<p>The two teams have each collected one win and one draw from their last six outings.</p>
<p>Alcorcón are 21st in the table after 18 games, of which they have won three and drawn five, earning 14 points.</p>
<p>Tenerife are 12 places ahead of AD Alcorcón in ninth, with eight wins and three draws putting them on 27 points.</p>
<p>In Juan Soriano Oropesa, CD Tenerife can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept eight clean sheets in his 18 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Sporting Gijón's Orlando Rubén Yáñez Alabart – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in the Segunda División.</p>
