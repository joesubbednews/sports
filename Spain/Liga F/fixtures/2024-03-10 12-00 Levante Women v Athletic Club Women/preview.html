<p style="font-weight: bold;">Levante Women face Athletic Club Women on Sunday seeking to protect their long unbeaten run in Liga F. </p>
<p> Levante are unbeaten in seven, with four wins and three draws, ahead of the 11am kick-off. </p>
<p> They face an Athletic Club team who have won three and drawn two over the same number of games.</p>
<p>With Emma Holmgren between the sticks, Levante can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept seven clean sheets in her 14 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Barcelona Women's Catalina Thomas Coll Lluch – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in Liga F. </p>
<p> In Athletic Club's net, Adriana Nanclares Romero has five clean sheets in 12 games. She has conceded a goal every 90 minutes, 80% more often than the 158 minutes between goals for Holmgren.</p>
