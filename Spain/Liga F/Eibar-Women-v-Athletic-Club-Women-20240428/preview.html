<p style="font-weight: bold;">Athletic Club Women are strong favourites to take all three points despite Eibar Women's home advantage in Sunday's early match at Instalaciones de Unbe. </p>
<p> *Betting Company* are offering odds of 1.85 on Athletic Club sealing the win, with the visitors sitting sixth in Liga F table. </p>
<p> Eibar, who are 11th in the league and 15 points behind Athletic Club, are priced at 3.25 to win. A draw is set at 3.75.</p>
<p>In Adriana Nanclares Romero, Athletic Club can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. She has kept eight clean sheets in her 18 appearances this season, and only one other 'keeper – Barcelona Women's Catalina Thomas Coll Lluch – has been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in Liga F. </p>
<p> In Eibar's net, María Miralles Gascón has seven clean sheets in 20 games. She has conceded a goal every 95 minutes, 10% more often than the 101 minutes between goals for Nanclares Romero.</p>
