<p style="font-weight: bold;">Rayo Vallecano come to Estadio de Mendizorroza to play Deportivo Alavés on Sunday lunchtime in terrible form, having collected just two points from their last six games.</p>
<p>The visitors have drawn two and lost four of their last six fixtures, while Alavés have a win and three draws.</p>
<p>With Stole Dimitrievski between the sticks, Rayo can rely on one of the league's safest pair of hands. He has kept nine clean sheets in his 27 appearances this season, and only two other 'keepers – Athletic Club Bilbao's Unai Simón and Real Sociedad's Álex Remiro – have been able to prevent the opposition scoring on more occasions in La Liga.</p>
<p>In Alavés's net, Antonio Sivera has six clean sheets in 27 games.</p>
<p>The visitors are 16th in the table after 27 games, of which they have won five and drawn 11, earning 26 points.</p>

<p>With 23 goals in 27 games so far this season, Rayo are the league's second-lowest scorers with 0.9 goals per game. And they are conceding more than average, letting in 37 goals at a rate of 1.4 per game.</p>
<p>The home side are also below average scorers, with 0.9 goals per game, compared to a league average of 1.3. They have conceded 1.2 goals per game.</p>
<p>In the last three years, Alavés and Rayo have played each other on three occasions. Alavés won one of them and Rayo the other.</p>
<p>Their last meeting was on September 15, when Rayo won 2-0 at home.</p>

<p>Sunday's match will be refereed by José Luis Munuera Montero, who has taken charge of 13 La Liga games so far this season, issuing three red cards and booking 69 players. He has awarded three penalties. </p>
<p>The last Alavés game Munuera Montero refereed was a 1-0 home loss to UD Las Palmas on December 9. His last Rayo match was their 2-1 loss away at RCD Mallorca on February 11.</p>
